# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Venus"
correspondence_astrological : "Aries"
correspondence_affirmation  : "My contributions are worthy of celebration."
correspondence_story 				: "We see a demonstration of the main character’s special gifts."

advice_relationships 	 : "Have you been together for ten years? Celebrate. Have you been together ten days? Celebrate. Do something to recognize the contribution of both partners. Alone? Celebrate yourself."

advice_work 					 : "Assign duties, delegate, and get out of the way. Allow others to contribute, even if their contributions aren’t exactly up to your personal standards. When projects end, thank everyone involved in a meaningful way."

advice_spirituality 	 : "It’s easy to allow any ritual to become empty. Get back in touch with what your rituals were meant to teach or inspire. When you restore meaning to your spiritual practice, every prayer becomes a celebration."

advice_personal_growth : "You can amplify individual achievements by becoming part of a group. Without decreasing the importance of your own contribution, you’ll achieve more…and have more to celebrate, too."

advice_fortune_telling : "Someone is watching and evaluating your work. You may get a wedding invitation soon."

questions	: ["To what extent is everyone in your group doing his or her part in your “harvest?”", "How might a celebration (or being reminded of what’s worth celebrating) better integrate the people working with you?", "To what extent am I doing my part?", "What kind of recognition or celebration would be most meaningful right now?", "How might a celebration now impact community morale?"]

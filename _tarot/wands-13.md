# more detail
correspondence_element 			: "Water"
correspondence_affirmation 	: "I use my influence to promote unity."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character must persuade others to follow his or her lead."

advice_relationships 	 : "Pull together a group of friends and organize a group date. If in an argument, make a special effort to see all sides. Refrain from thinking the issue at hand is “all about you.” Understand the motives of everyone involved, then go for common ground."

advice_work 					 : "Progress is complicated by a lack of attention to details. Start from square one. Ask everyone involved to give a stamp of approval to the parts of a project they control. Get more people involved, and more people will be invested in the success of your project."

advice_spirituality 	 : "A quiet mind is a sign of a focused spirit. When you’re feeling distracted, your spirit is pulled in every direction; when you’re focused, your energies flow naturally toward success. Take a deep breath, close your door, and invest a few minutes in calming yourself and your soul."

advice_personal_growth : "When you give someone your full and undivided attention, you give a rare and amazing gift. If you cultivate an ability to truly listen and respond, others will identify you as an intelligent, sensitive person they can trust with matters of real importance."

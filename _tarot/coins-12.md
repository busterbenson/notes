Taking care of others is admirable; take care of yourself, too. Watch for creative ways to enjoy time together without spending money."

advice_work 					 : "Keep an eye on the bottom line. Some times call for penny-pinching. At other times, growth many depend on generosity. There’s satisfaction in delivering a final, physical product. Keep an eye on the goal. Keep your commitments. Tackle big projects one step at a time."

questions	: ["What’s the difference between caution and fear?", "How can I evaluate the practicality of my own ideas and methods?", "How realistic are my goals?"]

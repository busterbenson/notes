correspondence_planet 			: "Saturn"
correspondence_astrological : "Capricorn"
correspondence_mystical 		: "The Biblical Satan, certainly. Fallen angels, including Lucifer. Bacchus and Pan. Tempters and serpents of every stripe."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character comes face to face with their adversary. Alternatively, the main character realizes that his or her own perceptions or actions are the cause of the story’s primary problem."

advice_relationships 	 : "Avoid the temptation to blame everything on everyone else; own your own contribution to the relationship’s success or failure. Doing what feels good is not always the best strategy. Take care that sexual attraction plays a healthy role; resist the tendency to be dominated by cravings."

advice_work 					 : "The bottom line is important, but not all-important. Do not allow material concerns to obscure human issues. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying or being compensated for good work—but keep the money in perspective. Know when to say, “Enough’s enough.”"

advice_spirituality 	 : "Many traditions position the body as bad or evil, something unclean. In your own spiritual practice, consider the wisdom of relishing the body and its spectrum of sensations. You can honor the pleasures of the body without being enslaved by them."

advice_personal_growth : "Be honest: what habit or attitude holds you back most? You might find that the qualities you most detest in others are, in fact, reflections of your darkest self. Rather than be chained to old attitudes or habits, embrace your shortcomings and strive to make more conscious choices."

advice_fortune_telling : "Adultery and unfaithfulness. A string of extremely bad luck is coming your way. Beware evil influences and wolves in sheep’s clothing."

questions	: ["Which plays the greatest role in your challenge: fear, attraction, or denial?", "What all-consuming obsession or passion plays a role in your situation?", "In your situation, are you being led by your conscience or your cravings?", "How might false unity or misrepresented loyalty play a role in your situation?", "What enslaves me? How can I set myself free?", "How can I reevaluate the importance I assign to superficial things?", "To what extent do my cravings define me?"]

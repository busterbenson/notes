# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Mars"
correspondence_astrological : "Pisces"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I take time to appreciate what I’ve been given."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character finds himself or herself in a relationship more fulfilling or intense than expected."

advice_relationships 	 : "Having it all may be a matter of perspective. Rather than pursue a fantasy romance, decide what you really want and need. Your relationship doesn’t require anyone else’s stamp of approval. Do what delights you, and be grateful for what you have."

advice_work 					 : "Fulfilling work is rare indeed. Be careful how you define success; don’t get so caught up in reaching the next goal that you forget to celebrate your achievements so far. Feeling overwhelmed? Take time out to count your blessings and realign your work with what matters most."

advice_spirituality 	 : "While we may glimpse nirvana in meditation, maintaining a constant state of bliss may prove to be an unrealistic goal. Delight in the small steps you take along the Path. Don’t be overly concerned with spiritual arrival; enjoy the journey."

advice_personal_growth : "Gratitude enhances success. While celebrating your achievements, remember to give credit to those who helped you achieve it. Overwhelm others with sincere recognition, and you’ll find yourself surrounded by an army of eager supporters."

advice_fortune_telling : "Marriage and family are in the cards. Expect a friendship to blossom into a romance."

questions	: ["In your situation, what’s been promised? Who has a promise to keep? What will it take to fulfill that promise?", "Who gets to define what “joy” consists of?", "What course of action is available when you feel overwhelmed?", "How might vows or promises play a role in achieving a greater level of joy in your life?"]

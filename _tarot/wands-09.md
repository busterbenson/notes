meaning_light  : "Sticking with it for the duration. Fulfilling your promises and obligations. Bearing up under incredible duress. Dragging yourself across the finish line.

meaning_shadow : "Making yourself a martyr. Abandoning your post. Giving up at the first sign of opposition. Being prevented from fulfilling an obligation. Failing to be dependable. Refusing to let something go that needs to be released. Beating a dead horse."

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Moon"
correspondence_astrological : "Sagittarius"
correspondence_affirmation  : "When the going gets tough, I stay the course."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character continues to strive for the goal, despite terrible odds."

advice_relationships 	 : "Sometimes relationships of any kind are hard work. You and your partner must be able to count on each other when the going gets rough. If you’ve been unreliable, it’s time to change your ways. If your partner doesn’t seem to be in things for the long haul, you should plan accordingly."

advice_work 					 : "When there’s hard work to be done, you learn who your real friends are. Call on others for support, especially if you feel overwhelmed. Take note of who responds. Recognize, too, when you’ve had enough; doggedly pressing on when you’re broken benefits no one."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Meaningful progress takes time. You’ll be tempted to give up, to abandon your practices, to shrug off your faith. Stick with it. Your transformation is slow, but steady. Encourage yourself by looking back and seeing how far you’ve come."

advice_personal_growth : "Know when to be a hero. Coached by phrases like “When the going gets tough, the tough get going,” you’ll be tempted to crawl ahead even when you’re down. Some causes deserve your total dedication; some don’t. Knowing the difference is an important component of maturity."

advice_fortune_telling : "Don’t relax yet; there’s more to come. The test you’re facing now is happening for one reason: to show you who your real friends are."

questions	: ["How do you cope when things get really tough?", "When you get low, what encourages you to go on?", "At what point should you be able to let this situation go?"]

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Mars"
correspondence_astrological : "Leo"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I am willing to take a stand for what I believe in."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character is attacked by the minions of his adversary."

advice_relationships 	 : "In a healthy relationship, each person feels secure. Partners and friends who constantly abuse others or tear people down must be confronted. Being in a relationship does not mean squelching your own unique insights; stand up for what you feel is right."

advice_work 					 : "The workplace tends to reward aggression. Defend yourself and your own work, making sure you have hard data to back up your claims. If you must become involved in unpleasantness, be sure those you investigate have no valid reason to feel attacked."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Especially when you feel attacked, your spirituality should guide you. Don’t be defensive; as a spiritual person, you know it’s “not about you.” As dramas unfold, stand up for your beliefs, but avoid absorbing and reflecting the poisonous emotions of others."

advice_personal_growth : "Standing up for yourself is healthy and reasonable. Turning the other cheek doesn’t mean making yourself into a doormat. It’s okay to insist on respect. Apply this principle to your interactions with others, too; it’s easier to get fair treatment when you’re known for treating others fairly."

advice_fortune_telling : "Don’t be surprised by a personal attack. Prepare to defend yourself or someone you love."

questions	: ["What is being threatened here? Is it worth fighting for?", "A crisis has the power to reveal what we really value. In your situation, how far are you willing to go to stand up for what you believe in?", "When do you feel most threatened? When do you get defensive?", "How capable are you of defending yourself?", "What kinds of beliefs are worth defending?"]

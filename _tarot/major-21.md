advice_relationships 	 : "With mutual trust and effort, very different people can come together to create a reality greater than the sum of its parts. Once you have a taste of what can be, settling for less will be difficult. Keep in mind, though, that a dream of perfection can foster dissatisfaction with an otherwise perfectly good relationship."

advice_work 					 : "Synergy! It’s possible for everyone involved to work together in harmony to create something better than any one person could produce on his or her own. Encourage people to share ideas. Allow others to share in the investment—and the glory. Unite and meet your goals."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Enlightenment is a goal; reaching it is bliss. Rather than beat yourself up for falling short, celebrate your progress. Meantime, keep in mind the lesson of the Tarot: Even as we reach one level of enlightenment, we become a fool again."

advice_personal_growth : "For most challenges, both intuitive and logical approaches exist. Most of us favor one over the other, but the secret to true mastery involves learning to wield both with perfect facility. Identify your least favorite approach, and then speed your growth by giving it special attention."

advice_fortune_telling : "Winning the lottery. Getting your heart’s desire. Having everything you ever imagined having."

questions	: ["If you examine the current situation in light of past events, what next step makes the most sense?", "What might happen if you put both your magical and practical powers to work today?", "For you, what would having it all mean?", "How aware are you of your own connectedness to the world around you?", "What keeps you from having it all right now, today?"]

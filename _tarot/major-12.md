advice_relationships 	 : "What doesn’t move forward isn’t growing. If you’re hanging by a thread, it might be time to grab the scissors. If you can learn from what’s not working, do so, but don’t equate learning with having to stay."

advice_work 					 : "Occasionally, no amount of effort will move a project to completion; progress simply isn’t the cards, despite your best efforts. Learn from setbacks; turn disappointment into opportunity."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Sometimes the best action is no action at all. Suspend your need to have a hand in things. Consider, too, the value of small sacrifices. What you give away will come back to you greatly multiplied."

advice_personal_growth : "One sign of maturity is your ability to deal effectively with the unexpected. Rather than be decimated, look for the lesson. If you’re true to your own values, no disaster will get the best of you."

advice_fortune_telling : "A traitor is revealed. One of your friends is working against you. Change your ways or suffer the consequences."

questions	: ["Are you bound to any old habits that, in this situation, betray you?", "What have your own trials taught you? How might those lessons apply now?", "How can I radically alter my perspective?", "How might being stuck actually be a blessing in disguise?", "How can I help myself see the glass as half full?"]

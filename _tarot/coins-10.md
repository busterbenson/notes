correspondence_astrological : "Virgo"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I keep physical and financial matters in perspective."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character turns down an extravagant reward for his or her good work. Alternatively, the main character is offered an attractive bribe."

advice_relationships 	 : "Being swept off your feet is one thing; being overwhelmed by sex or gifts is quite another. Keep a level head with regard to the importance of both presents and pleasure. Gifts and physical intimacy have an intensity all their own, but cannot compensate for genuine affection."

advice_work 					 : "Your skills are for sale—not your soul. In the long run, will any amount of money compensate for the loss of your health or self-respect? Look carefully at the carrots being dangled before you. Know when to say no. Celebrate what you have; debate whether more is needed."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Lots of “stuff” can blind us to or distract us from our deepest, most important needs. Lighten the load. Consider giving away some of the possessions that weight you down. When blessings overflow, share them with others."

advice_personal_growth : "You are not defined by your paycheck, by the size of your home, or by memberships in exclusive clubs. Behind all the possessions, behind the physical shell, there is only you; instead of focusing on the externals, make sure you’re at peace with the person you really are."

advice_fortune_telling : "Big money is in the near future. Expect a powerful blessing to come your way."

questions	: ["How much stuff do I really need?", "How do I feel about wealth and abundance? How do I define these terms?", "How might shedding some possessions open room for growth?"]

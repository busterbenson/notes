correspondence_story 				: "An unforeseen event, completely out of the main character’s control, changes everything. Alternatively, decisions made in the past have unexpected present-day consequences."

advice_relationships 	 : "You can’t plan every moment. Be spontaneous. Rather than strive for control, let go of the reins and see where the relationship goes. Check your behaviors. Are you reliving mistakes of the past?"

advice_work 					 : "Feeling a little deja-vu? Return to old files; new solutions might be lying dormant there. Ask yourself what this new opportunity has in common with older challenges. In analysis, take into account all influences, including those beyond your control."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Behold the delicate machinery of heaven! As you watch events unfold, keep your perspective. What seems impossible to understand today will make sense with the passing of time. Look for the larger patterns."

advice_personal_growth : "The actions you take today will influence your reality for days and years to come. Making wise choices now can free you from the unpleasant business of enduring repercussions further down the road."

advice_fortune_telling : "Some events are in the hands of heaven. You’ve lived through this before. What happened then?"

questions	: ["Considering the four evangelists, which strategy would help you most: tracing roots, communication, sacrifice, or mystery?", "What might happen if you rearranged the basic elements of your situation?", "Can you place yourself, and your situation, within a larger cycle?", "How does this challenge fit into a larger pattern?", "What role does luck play in my circumstances?", "What can I control? How should I know when to relinquish control?"]

advice_relationships 	 : "A relationship should empower you. Does yours generate positive change in your life? Do you feel happier and more fulfilled? A relationship that supports your goals is to be valued; a relationship that doesn’t must be changed or cast aside."

advice_work 					 : "Exercise whatever authority you have. With the right resources, you’ll succeed. But not everyone who appears empowered really is. With an eye toward growth, seek allies who focus on steak, not sizzle. Be a mentor … or find one. Deploy tools and resources against well-defined goals."

advice_spirituality 	 : "If others were to see you and your life as an expression of the Divine, what would their impression of the Divine be? How can you improve that perception? How can you better dedicate yourself to being a channel for positive energy in the world?"

advice_personal_growth : "Asserting yourself can be an important step toward wholeness. When your work or life experience has given you special insights or talents, shrug off self-doubt and apply them fearlessly. Act confidently, and feelings of confidence will follow."

advice_fortune_telling : "A powerful man may play a role in your day. Your current situation must be seen as one element of a much larger plan."

questions	: ["Which approach takes best advantage of both your masculine and feminine perspectives?", "What am I empowered to do?", "What would you do if you weren't afraid of failing?", "How might my abilities come into play?", "To what extent am I making the most of my talents?", "Which tool do you need today?", "Would it help to try to channel some form of higher power?"]

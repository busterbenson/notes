correspondence_story 				: "An event hints at the main character’s hidden strength, which he or she will use (or choose not to use) to resolve the story. Alternatively, a physical or emotional weakness hinders the main character’s progress."

advice_relationships 	 : "You’re in control. You can’t tame others, but you can rein yourself in. Watch for old habits or weaknesses to surface, and use your wits to avoid upcoming pitfalls."

advice_work 					 : "Emotions and distractions can hinder progress. Identify the cause of dissention and take steps to moderate it. Allow people (including yourself) to do what they do best. An objective perspective yields more effective action."

advice_spirituality 	 : "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Your own willpower may not be strong enough to resist the temptations that come your way. (That’s okay; you’re human.) Turn challenges over to a higher power, and allow yourself to be led."

advice_personal_growth : "Identify problematic habits and unhealthy tendencies, and weigh their overall impact on your life. Consider, too, the value of leaving these behind for healthier options. A good measure of maturity is the ability to forgo immediate gratification to reap benefits later."

advice_fortune_telling : "Your self-control will be tested. A woman will seek to change her partner or lover. You are a strong, capable person."

questions	: ["What role does self-discipline play in your situation?", "What instinctual responses have you been skillfully managing?", "How can I enhance my self-discipline?", "What behaviors tempt me? How can I resist?", "What instincts do I continue to struggle with today?"]

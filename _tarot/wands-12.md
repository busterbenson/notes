correspondence_element 			: "Air"
correspondence_affirmation 	: "I can lead the way to success."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character leads the effort to reach a common goal."

advice_relationships 	 : "Ask someone out. Set up a romantic evening and make it happen. Speak your heart, and challenge others to do the same. Be feverishly romantic. Pull out all the stops. After making sure your motives are pure, use your charisma to bowl someone over."

advice_work 					 : "If you are not equipped to be a charismatic advocate for your ideas, find a champion and enlist his or her aid. Your focus today is more on “sizzle” than “steak.” Sell your ideas and skills as boldly as you can without distorting or exaggerating their value. Stress benefits and push for commitments."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Without coming off as a fanatic, you can share your spiritual journey with others. Offer prayers. Mention important Truths you’ve learned to apply. Loan out your books. Mention your faith in a letter to a friend. Every time you share your Light, you aid in conquering Darkness."

advice_personal_growth : "Share yourself. Watch for opportunities to lend a hand, offer your skills, or lead an effort others will avoid. Prove yourself in small things, and others will be willing to follow you into larger battles."

correspondence_story 				: "A motherly or nurturing figure reminds the main character of the core values that are the essence of his or her character."

advice_relationships 	 : "Without going overboard, revel in your sensuality. Take care you don’t produce more than you intended; the moment is pregnant with possibility. Be lavish with demonstrations of affection. Watch for what a friend or partner needs, and then supply it in abundance."

advice_work 					 : "Now is the time to get things done. Wrap up projects. Ask for resources. Meet deadlines. Move ahead. During this time of growth and expansion, be sure you have the skills and training you need. In the meantime, don’t mistake a headlong rush for focused, verifiable progress."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Women are the figurative and literal door to this world. This moment, too, can be a door for you—a threshold you cross into a new awareness. Watch for physical ways to express your spiritual insights. Reconnect with nurturing, feminine images of divinity, including nature."

advice_personal_growth : "Your attitudes toward women (and your insights into your own feminine qualities) are likely rooted in early experiences. How can you emulate the best female role models you’ve encountered? How can you transcend female influences that harm or hold you back?"

advice_fortune_telling : "Pregnancy is in the cards. An opportunity to be involved in luxurious sexuality is coming. Beware a tendency toward addiction."

questions	: ["What do you have dominion over?", "How might themes of comfort or indulgence impact your situation?", "In your situation, what outcome struggles to be born?", "What would a concerned and capable mother do?", "What can I do that would emphasize growth?", "How can I celebrate my own sensuality and sexuality?"]

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Venus"
correspondence_astrological : "Aquarius"
correspondence_affirmation  : "Even as I care for myself, I am mindful of the needs of others."
correspondence_story 				: "Others are shocked or angered by the main character's apparently irrational actions. Alternatively, the Main Character must take an action that will cause pain for his or her loved ones."

advice_relationships 	 : "It’s crazy to think that one person in a relationship deserves more pleasure or power than the other. Balance must be restored. You’re not thinking clearly now, so back off and rethink your approach. Take care of yourself, but try to do so without hurting those you love most."

advice_work 					 : "Occasionally, one person’s success will bring about another person’s loss. When you’re the successful one, don’t gloat; be humble. When you suffer the loss, don’t despair; pick up the pieces and move on. Don’t drive yourself crazy asking “Why?” Breaking a rule may prove to be the key to innovation."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Suffering is a fact of life. How does your spiritual path deal with the reality of suffering or the pain of inequality? It’s easy to be spiritual when all is well. Insulate yourself from instability by thinking—in advance—of how you’ll deal with adversity when it comes your way."

advice_personal_growth : "You can’t win every fight. With this truth in mind, think in terms of how you want to win…and how you want to lose. Rather than be driven by emotion, make conscious choices in both situations. Resolve to be noble in both victory and defeat."

advice_fortune_telling : "Someone is stealing from you, financially or romantically. Be wary of friends who talk behind your back."

questions	: ["When's the last time you came out on top? What does that say about me?", "When the instability of the Five combines with the thoughtfulness of the suit of Swords, logic gives way to irrationality. Rules are shattered, and the whole world turns upside down. What would happen if you broke some rules?", "How can I do what’s necessary without making others feel defeated?", "What’s the difference between selfish action and acting in my own best interest?"]

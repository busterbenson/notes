advice_relationships 	 : "Give freely of yourself and expect the best. Don’t hold back genuine emotions; express them without shame. Consider exploring spiritual goals together. Astrology can offer important insights into compatibility. Let your honesty and openness encourage others to reveal their deepest thoughts."

advice_work 					 : "Surround yourself with visual reminders of your goal because these can serve as guiding lights when you need a way to put the situation into perspective. Expect the best of yourself and your co-workers. You’ll know when the time is right to take action; have confidence in your own judgment."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Prayer and quiet time communicate your openness to guidance from above. Don’t hesitate to share your spiritual side with those around you. Seek out oracles. Allow the power of spirit to flow through you; let your spirituality color all aspects of your life."

advice_personal_growth : "An optimist sees what is -- and what can be. Open yourself to possibility. Numbers never tell the whole story. Shed your ego; be yourself, no matter what others think. The only truly unique thing you have to share is the person you really are. Unmask!"

advice_fortune_telling : "Get an astrology chart drawn up. Someone is a little too starstruck. What’s happening now has long been fore-ordained."

questions	: ["What would happen if you embraced yourself completely?", "What might a higher power direct me to do?", "How can I be less self-conscious and guarded?", "How can I better attune myself to the abundance of life’s blessings?"]

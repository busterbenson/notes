advice_relationships 	 : "Moonlight becomes you, so don’t be afraid to indulge in a little romantic lunacy. Navigating your way to a fulfilling relationship involves risks. Some people will say you’re crazy. Pay attention to your instincts, surround yourself with loyal guides, and make your move."

advice_work 					 : "Avoid linear/logical approaches and go with your gut. Brainstorm. Put the rules aside and use your imagination. What would happen if restrictions were removed? What might happen? What could happen? A little lunacy can be a good thing; blow off steam, change your habits, and try working in a different light."

advice_spirituality 	 : "How does your personal spiritual path incorporate the Divine Feminine? What qualities would a divine mother offer? Which aspects of your personal spirituality would benefit from a feminine touch? How might contact with the divine feminine benefit you today? How might you honor or invite that energy?"

advice_personal_growth : "Faced with an uncertain future, you might feel led to abandon your search for self and crawl back into your shell. You can move forward without tossing caution to the wind. Uncertainty can be the mother of great creativity. Listen your instincts, clarify your path, and keep going."

advice_fortune_telling : "Watch for problems at the end of the month. Someone you know needs to howl at the moon more often. Someone is about to change his or her mind about an important decision."

questions	: ["How is your situation shaped by repeating events? By rare ones?", "To what extent might your own fears be rooted in imagination alone?", "What is your greatest fear? Does it play a role in your current situation?", "How can I face my fears and move forward?", "What helpers can serve me as guides through my personal darkness?", "How can I deal with the unknown in healthy ways?"]

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Sun"
correspondence_astrological : "Scorpio"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I freely give myself to others, expecting nothing in return."
correspondence_story 				: "Defying conventional wisdom, the main character lends his or her support to a hopeless cause."

advice_relationships 	 : "We like to say relationships involve give and take; this card invites you to focus on giving more than receiving. Watch for opportunities to take on chores that neither you nor your friends (or partners) enjoy. Surprise a loved one with an unexpected, unmerited gift."

advice_work 					 : "Most people focus on profit; what might happen if you focused on giving instead? A gift given with strings attached deserves a skeptical response. When charitable gestures are revealed (or perceived) as bribes, don’t expect good results."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Few things energize the weary spirit like service. Volunteer. Lend a helping hand to someone in need. Give of your time, your money, and your talents—all three. In helping others, you help yourself."

advice_personal_growth : "When you can give something without expecting anything in return, you’ve reached an important milestone. Accelerate your quest for maturity; practice giving with no thought of what’s in it for you."

advice_fortune_telling : "A stingy spirit is strangling your enjoyment of life. Loosen up and think of others for once, why don’t you?"

questions	: ["How might expectations of payment (or repayment) be shaping your own situation?", "Does your question hinge on a scarcity mentality or an abundance mentality?", "What gifts do I possess? How freely do I give them?", "How can I practice unconditional giving?", "How would things change if I became a more charitable person?"]

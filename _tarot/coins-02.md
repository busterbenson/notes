# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Jupiter"
correspondence_astrological : "Capricorn"
correspondence_affirmation  : "Before taking action, I consider costs."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character weighs the impact his or her course of action will have on everyone involved."

advice_relationships 	 : "What does this relationship cost you? If this relationship were an investment, how profitable would it be? This card extends an invitation to consider the pros and cons of your relationship. Before taking action, consider what you have to gain … and what you have to lose."

advice_work 					 : "How well do you balance demands of work and life? Remember: you should be working to live, not living to work. If the job is dominating your schedule, press back. If unfettered playtime is ruining your productivity, sober yourself by tallying up the time and money lost to distractions."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Of the many options you have for service, which will ultimately do everyone the most good? Identify your skills and talents, and use these as a means of illuminating your own best contribution. Pair your resources with those of other, like-minded people and get twice as much done in half the time."

advice_personal_growth : "Be aware of how you determine value. What matters? What doesn’t? Before you can answer these questions, you must have a firm grip on your own value system. Making a choice becomes infinitely easier when you have a firm grip on what you value and why."

advice_fortune_telling : "It’s time to balance the budget. Avoid the temptation to spend critical funds on frivolous goods."

questions	: ["What course of action best suits your long-term goals?", "In your situation, what happens if you ask for help?", "What happens if you do what you can do without asking for additional resources?", "What values govern my decisions?", "How willing am I to sacrifice a little pleasure now in order to have more pleasure later on?", "Given my current situation, which course of action will give me more of what I really need?"]

# more detail
correspondence_element 			: "Fire"
correspondence_affirmation 	: "I use my authority and experience to get things done faster."
correspondence_story 				: "Surrounded by indecision, the Main Character takes control and gives orders."

advice_relationships 	 : "When it comes to your own relationships, you’re in the driver’s seat. What do you want? Are you getting it? If not, why not? While relationships are a two-way street, you ultimately decide whether or not you will continue to be involved. It could be time to lay down the law."

advice_work 					 : "Someone in authority needs to be calling the shots. There is a need for input from an experienced worker who has been empowered to cut through red tape and make things happen. If you’re that person, step up. If you’re not that person, step aside."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Who’s in control? We like to think we hold the reins of our lives, but all too often, the Universe reminds us that we are a very small cog in a very large machine. Consider today the role you play in larger plans, and make yourself available to be a means for accomplishing great things."

advice_personal_growth : "In order to achieve your goals, you must control what you can: your habits, your choices, your schedule. Without being rigid, you can put a structure in place that takes the craziness out of the most hectic days. That foundation will help you maintain the calmness of a King, even when the castle walls are falling down around you."

advice_fortune_telling : "This card represents an older man with a commanding, charismatic personality, likely born between November 13th and December 12th, who prefers to give directions and have them followed."

questions	: ['Many are eager for power and authority, but few are prepared to accept the consequences of absolute power. Are you?', 'How confident a leader are you?', 'How is confidence projected and what is it useful for?', 'How can you offer my expertise in ways that inspire others to follow you?', 'In your situation, who is trying to appear impervious to attack, like the salamander? Why?']

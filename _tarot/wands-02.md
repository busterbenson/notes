meaning_light  : "Having a choice. Offering or being offered an option. Seeing the value of another person’s approach. Understanding there’s more than one way to “skin a cat.” Successfully doing more than one thing at a time. Being empowered to make a choice."

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Mars"
correspondence_astrological : "Aries"
correspondence_story 				: "The main character is confronted with an alternative goal."
correspondence_affirmation  : "With my goals in mind, I make confident choices."

advice_relationships 	 : "To what extent does everyone involved in your situation want the same thing? The actions people take reveal their true inclinations. To gain insight into the goals of others, study what they do. Are their actions in line with their stated goals? Are yours?"

advice_work 					 : "No one can serve two masters. Before proceeding, determine exactly how much authority you have in this matter. In addition, it’s time to decide which “To Do” items move you closer to your personal goals…and which ones are merely consuming your limited time and energy."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Others will have their opinions, but ultimately, you must decide what spiritual practices are right for you. Speak your mind and share your own views with courage and honesty. Answering the call of Spirit may dictate taking the road less traveled by."

advice_personal_growth : "While others become slaves to fashion and convention, you should work to express yourself. What sets you apart? What makes you unique? These are qualities worth celebrating. Rather than give in to brow-beating and peer pressure, set your own standards in all things."

advice_fortune_telling : "Beware false friends. Don’t be mealy-mouthed; say what you think and do what you want to do."

questions	: ["If you could hold the world in your hands, would this help you make a better decision?", "In a conflict, how do you decide who wins?", "What values govern your decision-making process?", "What choice will you make if you make no choice at all?"]

meaning_light  : "Holding your own in extreme circumstances. Helping others carry their burdens. Coming to the aid of the oppressed. Knowing and being honest about your own limits. Recognizing when you are not well-suited for a particular task."

meaning_shadow : "Taking on more work than you know you can handle. Refusing to say “No” when you’re already overloaded. Making a habit of working overtime. Shielding others from facing the consequences of their own poor judgment. Over-extending yourself on a regular basis."

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Saturn"
correspondence_astrological : "Sagittarius"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I respect my own limits."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character attempts a task he is not well-suited for, with disastrous results."

advice_relationships 	 : "Some relationships become a burden. When this happens, have the presence of mind to put them aside. Relationships involve more than one person. When you’ve done all you can do to make a relationship a success, there’s no shame in withdrawing from a bad situation."

advice_work 					 : "Over-extending yourself on a regular basis is not a sign of strength: it’s evidence of poor judgment. You cannot perform at your best when exhausted. There are too many irons in the fire. Review your values and make tough choices, letting go of work that isn’t critical."

advice_spirituality 	 : "When we are exhausted, we tend to feel disconnected from Spirit. Restore yourself (and your spirit) by scheduling regular quiet time. Guard this appointment with contemplative silence as jealously as you would an appointment with a life-saving doctor. Disconnect—and reconnect."

advice_personal_growth : "Knowing your own limits is a sign of maturity. Don’t take on more than you can reliably handle. It’s better to be respected for saying “No” than hated for saying “Yes” and failing to deliver. When unreasonable demands are made, point them out and sidestep them."

advice_fortune_telling : "You’re worn out! Back off, take a time out, and let someone else handle things for a while."

questions	: ["How will you know when you reach the end of your rope?", "How easily do you say no to new projects and requests?", "What projects could you delegate or even eliminate, when the energy to attend to them is lacking?"]

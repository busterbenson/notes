correspondence_mystical 		: "The angel seen here may be the goddess Iris. By extension, priests, priesthoods, or the transfigured Christ."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character learns to moderate impulses or habits that limit his or her ability to solve the story’s central problem."

advice_relationships 	 : "Set superficial relationships aside. Pursue trust and deep intimacy—the subtle blending of two people into one. Bring people together. Commit to introductions, parties, or gatherings. Seek out groups."

advice_work 					 : "Many hands make work easier. Call meetings. Get input from every level at every step. If everyone has a hand in defining an effort, then everyone will feel ownership and investment. Moderate your tendency toward all-or-nothing work habits."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Some spiritual advisors recommend extreme practices, from fasting to abstinence, as a means of boosting spiritual awareness. Consider the potential value of moderation in all things. You can value what is right here, right now, without craving more or surpassing healthy limits."

advice_personal_growth : "Young people want to toss out tradition and forge ahead. Older people are more conservative. Between these extremes lies a healthier middle ground. Define the polarities and then ask, “What lies between?”"

advice_fortune_telling : "Someone’s using drugs or alcohol to excess. It’s time to get back on that diet."

questions	: ["Are you seeing things in black and white that might be more clearly seen as a spectrum?", "How might blending two opposites resolve your challenge today?", "What would happen if you broke down the situation?", "How can you avoid extremes?", "What do the different sides have in common?", "How might combining familiar things help me create something new?"]

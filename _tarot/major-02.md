correspondence_mystical 		: "The feminine aspect of divinity, particularity when expressed through virginity, as with the Virgin Mary or Isis."
correspondence_story 				: "An unexpected event contains seeds of discord with potential to disrupt the main character’s everyday world."

advice_relationships 	 : "Your heart is your best source of information now; listen to it. Set, communicate, and respect sexual limits. Don’t tell everything you know; one element of attraction is mystery. Still, don’t be a puzzle; communicate your needs and the reasons for them. Watch and learn."

advice_work 					 : "Play your cards close to the vest. Reveal your insights to a chosen few. Rather than take rash action now, keep still and observe. Hold your tongue and learn by listening. Listen to your gut instincts. When the time comes for action, you’ll know."

advice_spirituality 	 : "The unconventional image of a papess recalls the legend of the heretical, cross-dressing Pope Joan, whose true gender was revealed when she unexpectedly gave birth. Consider alternative spiritual paths or nontraditional applications of your familiar faith."

advice_personal_growth : "Learning to listen can be the most difficult lesson of all. Invest energy in the transformational discipline of silence. Disengaging from the drive to respond will free you to reflect. As an observer, you will see patterns participants will overlook."

advice_fortune_telling : "A mysterious woman arrives. A sexual secret may surface. Someone knows more than he or she will reveal."

questions	: ["What is your intuition telling you?", "How might you use your unique circumstances, opportunities, and strengths to establish something new in the world?", "What might a rebel against tradition do?", "What isn’t being said or revealed?", "What could be achieved by observing and reflecting?"]

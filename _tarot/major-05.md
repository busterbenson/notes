advice_relationships 	 : "A relationship should be more than just going through the motions. Seek the deeper meaning of small gestures and daily chores. Emphasize signs that those involved have real faith in the partnership. If necessary, seek guidance from a spiritual leader or counselor."

advice_work 					 : "Seek training or a mentor, particularly if you are having difficulty understanding a complex assignment or when adjusting to new professional surroundings. See your daily work as an expression of your faith. Take traditional routes instead of innovative, unproven measures."

advice_spirituality 	 : "See familiar spiritual symbols in a new light by pursuing a deeper understanding of them. If you’re a lone practitioner, consider the value of joining a like-minded group or learning from a worthy teacher. What are the larger truths behind the rituals or stories you’ve learned?"

advice_personal_growth : "In time, everyone must deal with conflicts between experience and faith. Where do you find your personal center? Values dictate behavior, so work to define what you truly believe in. Don’t shy away from the big questions, but be wary of gurus bearing quick answers."

advice_fortune_telling : "Expect to be caught in a misdeed and punished accordingly. Pray for forgiveness and confess wrongdoings. A more experienced man, spiritual leader, or father figure will come into your life."

questions	: ["How is your own faith (or lack of faith) reflected in this situation?", "Are there outdated beliefs you’d do well to abandon?", "What urges or inclinations are you being called upon to control?", "If you were in a respected position of power, what changes would you make?", "What role might tradition or religion play in this situation?", "Who authored the rules? Who enforces them? Why?", "How might an experienced guide impact this situation?"]

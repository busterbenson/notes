advice_relationships 	 : "You’re turning heads without realizing it. Attention is coming your way -- and you deserve it! The admiration of others is a warm glow, so bask in it while you can. As all things begin to revolve around you, take care you don’t get blinded or burned by your own brilliance."

advice_work 					 : "With the proper strategy, you’re all set to be the golden boy (or girl). Approval and praise are the order of the day. Accept all this admiration with humbleness; give credit where credit’s due. Meanwhile, make hay while the sun shines. Remember: after noon, the rest of the day is a sunset!"

advice_spirituality 	 : "As your meditative and spiritual practices hone your sensitivities, you begin to feel your connectedness to the energies around you. Branch out. Spread warmth, love, and joy through your attitudes and actions. Today, embody the universal light."

advice_personal_growth : "Learn to win gracefully. Accept compliments with a humble heart. You can acknowledge and celebrate your own achievements without falling prey to greediness. Be who you are. You’ve earned this moment, but don’t let pride in your progress hinder further growth!"

advice_fortune_telling : "Everything’s coming up roses (or sunflowers, whatever the case may be). Whatever’s on your mind, go for it because you can’t lose today."

questions	: ["Who do you respect the most? What would they do?", "In your situation, where do you connect with beginner's mind?", "How does a loss of innocence figure in your situation?", "If you were to undergo a spritual transformation, what would that mean to you?", "How can I take best advantage of the attention coming my way?", "What are my highest spiritual goals?", "How can I avoid being bedazzled by the energy swirling around me?"]

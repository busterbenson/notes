correspondence_astrological : "Cancer"
correspondence_mystical 		: "Odysseus. Jason. The search for the Holy Grail. Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem."
correspondence_story 				: "With an eye toward solving the story’s central problem, the main character commits to a quest, usually at the end of the first act."

advice_relationships 	 : "Moving forward to mutual victory requires trust and cooperation. If you have this already, depend on it during an upcoming challenge. If you lack it, consider what choices have prevented forming this kind of bond. Don’t rest on your laurels; successful romance is an ongoing commitment."

advice_work 					 : "What do you need to move forward? Now is the time to summon resources and plan for future success. Past successes might not be an indicator of current value. Remember that employers tend to ask “What have you done for me lately?” Work accordingly."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Celebrate spiritual achievement, but be aware that a sense of having arrived can be the first step toward disastrous vanity. The goal is not to be a guru, but to achieve balance and stability. As you make progress, extend a helping hand to others who still await their chariot moment."

advice_personal_growth : "Reaching a new plane of maturity is exciting, so some celebration is in order. Every ending, though, is a new beginning; keep an eye fixed on further growth. Having reached the limits of mundane success, it’s time to work on deeper transformation."

advice_fortune_telling : "Victory is a certainty. Move ahead with all plans. Beware the jealousy of others."

questions	: ["What mystery must be solved in order to start moving forward?", "How might your situation change if you commanded unlimited creative energy?", "To what extent have I arrived? What will my next challenge be?", "How can I use past achievements to their best advantage?", "What would the criteria for real and meaningful success be?"]

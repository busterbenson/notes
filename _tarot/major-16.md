correspondence_story 				: "In a moment of intense crisis, the main character apparently loses all. Alternatively, the utter setback at the end of act 2."

advice_relationships 	 : "Extinguish old flames before they have an opportunity to dampen promising new relationships. Despite the pain involved, a clean break is healthier than a lingering, drawn-out departure. Break down the walls and communicate honestly about what’s really happening."

advice_work 					 : "Sacrifice some sacred cows. Harsh criticism from above can clear ground for a new breakthrough. Something is blocking progress; identify it and boldly sweep it aside. Document everything; should the climate suddenly change, you want your ducks in a row."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Loss clears away the debris of the past, opening up new ground for new growth. As your heart opens, let old scar tissue fall away. Rather than live in fear of sudden loss, recognize that none of us owns anything. Practice detachment."

advice_personal_growth : "Identify what holds you back and attack it. Embrace bold change. Criticism may come; if so, search each barbed word for a kernel of much-needed truth. Some of life’s greatest lessons are tough ones! With time, a bruised ego can become fertile ground for personal growth and maturity."

advice_fortune_telling : "Impending disaster. Cancel plans and reverse decisions. Someone wants to take you down a notch or two. Don’t hold back; say what you really mean."

questions	: ["In what ways have you hit bottom?", "How might the current situation dramatically alter my perspective?", "How might this loss open the door for new growth?", "What attitudes need to be struck down before I proceed?"]

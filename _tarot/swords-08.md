meaning_light  : "Honoring limits. Respecting the rules. Deciding to go on a diet for your health’s sake. Recognizing you cannot always be in control. Identifying obstacles to further progress. Refusing to think about unhealthy or unethical options. Asking for assistance."

# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Jupiter"
correspondence_astrological : "Gemini"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I know my own limits."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character must call on his or her ingenuity to escape a trap."

advice_relationships 	 : "Feeling boxed in? You have exactly as many options as you imagine you do. There is a way out, but someone is refusing to see it. A relationship should broaden horizons, not limit them. If the rules are uncomfortable, perhaps it’s time to re-examine them."

advice_work 					 : "Some restrictions are necessary; others are merely tradition. Ethics demand you play by the rules; sacred cows, however, are fair game. What are the obstacles, exactly? If your limits didn’t exist, how might you move forward? Thinking freely will open unexpected options."

advice_spirituality 	 : "The free spirit cannot be contained by the physical constraints. As you learn to cultivate balance and focus, you may find that most obstacles are self-imposed and most limits are strictly imaginary. When you focus your will, blindfolds and bonds will fall away."

advice_personal_growth : "Knowing your own limits is important; respect them. Whatever the issue, you’re balking for a reason. There’s no harm in refusing to move forward for now, and no shame in saying, “No.” A mature person communicates what he or she needs with absolute confidence."

advice_fortune_telling : "Get over playing the victim. Once you realize you are your own biggest obstacle, nothing can hold you back."

questions	: ["Has the Universe been showing you an escape route you’ve been too proud or too distracted to see? What might happen if, instead of moving obediently from A to B, you rudely jumped over the walls?", "Who’s empowered to cut through the red tape?", "What, exactly, are the obstacles? What resources, exactly, are needed to move them?", "To what extent is your powerlessness a matter of attitude?"]

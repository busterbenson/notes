# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Venus"
correspondence_astrological : "Cancer"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I am attuned to what my heart truly desires."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character improves his or her lot by joining with likeminded others."

advice_relationships 	 : "In a healthy relationship, everyone involved feels safe enough to reveal how he or she really feels. Feeling attraction? Say so. Not invested? Say so. Reflected love is a balm for the soul, but hidden or repressed emotions will poison a relationship."

advice_work 					 : "Meet your goals more easily by recruiting others who see things your way. If what you’re doing now doesn’t thrill you, admit it. Do what delights you, or engineer a change of heart that allows you to enjoy what you’re doing now."

advice_spirituality 	 : "The idea that your spiritual practice must satisfy anyone other than yourself is an illusion. Do what you feel drawn to do. Find support and solace with like-minded individuals. Forgive spiritual abuse and rediscover the power of unity."

advice_personal_growth : "Rather than merely reflect the desires of others, identify what you want and be yourself. You can appreciate others without sacrificing your individuality. Honesty is power; be brave enough to admit what you really feel."

advice_fortune_telling : "Someone has a secret crush on you. Relationships should be mutual; get rid of a leech."

questions	: ["How might affection be the balm for what ails you now?", "In your situation, what’s missing? What’s needed in order to be complete?", "Do your relationships and alliances incorporate a cycle of healthy interdependence and mutual support?", "The couple here seems to be on the verge of a toast. What do you need to celebrate? To acknowledge? To embrace?", "How can I make sure that what I’m feeling is mutual?", "When was the last time I felt “in love” with someone or something?", "What do you need in order to feel emotionally stable?"]

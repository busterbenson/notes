advice_relationships 	 : "There’s a reason we say we “fall” in love! Each new romance makes us as giddy as a total beginner. Don’t allow old habits to smother opportunities for growth. You can break rules without resorting to rash action—and you don’t have to be in control all the time."

advice_work 					 : "Leap over limits. Don’t waver; now’s the time to jump, even if you don’t have all the facts in hand. Remember that once, every new direction was just another crazy idea. Be prepared, though. Later, your results will determine whether others deem you clever or crazy."

advice_spirituality 	 : "You are old and young, wise and inexperienced. Life is a cycle of cycles; find your place in the dance and start dancing. Reinvention is the key to transformation. See who you are, but acknowledge, too, the person you can be. Grace abounds; embrace it. Consider Zen meditation."

advice_personal_growth : "Without falling for every scheme that comes your way, you can cultivate an openness to life. What are your limits? What boundaries define you? What might happen if you step outside those definitions? With eyes wide open, expand your world today."

advice_fortune_telling : "Watch for new projects and new beginnings. Prepare to take something on faith. Something new comes your way; go for it."

questions	: ["What would I do if I felt free to take a leap?", "How willing am I to be vulnerable and open?", "How might past experiences help in this new situation?", "In your situation, what works best: your feet on the ground or head in the clouds?", "How capable are you of embracing everyone, regardless of their social status or percieved foolishness?", "How might the jester's strategy of delivering direct feedback wrapped in humor and kindness work for you?"]

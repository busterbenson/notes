# more detail
correspondence_planet 			: "Mercury"
correspondence_astrological : "Aquarius"
correspondence_affirmation  : "I keep an open mind."
correspondence_story 				: "The main character comes up with a creative solution to handle an unforeseen complication."

advice_relationships 	 : "Relationships involve give and take. Prepare for some compromises. Someone may have to adjust expectations in order to be happy. Look around; you may find better options elsewhere. How long since you sat down and discussed what works and what doesn’t?"

advice_work 					 : "Times change, and the wise businessperson changes with them. Reinvent yourself and your approach to work. Seeking inspiration, go places you don’t normally go. Find out what’s on the “cutting edge.” Now is a good time for business trips, seminars, and training sessions."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Attend a workshop or seminar and learn new spiritual techniques. Consider taking a trip exclusively for the purpose of enhancing your spiritual perspective. If a discipline isn’t helping you, abandon it, but not without defining what worked, what didn’t work, and why."

advice_personal_growth : "Reaching out to others in need will rapidly advance your growth and maturity. Don’t make the mistake of thinking everyone wants what you want; ask people what they need, and find a way to supply it without strings attached. Know why you do what you do."

advice_fortune_telling : "You’ll soon go on a long journey over water. Actions have unexpected consequences, so be prepared."

questions	: ["What are you leaving? Where are you going?", "In your situation, who needs help? To what extent are you positioned to supply that help?", "What assumptions govern my thinking?", "How willing am I to lend aid to others? To request it when I need it?", "How prepared am I to deal with change? With unexpected outcomes?"]

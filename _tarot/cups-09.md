correspondence_story 				: "The main character expresses supreme confidence. Alternatively, the Main Character completes a task, but is denied the promised payment."

advice_relationships 	 : "Appreciate what you have. When things are good, it’s easy to take someone for granted. Today, emphasize the ways your friendships and relationships are working for you. What’s working? What’s comforting? What do you have to smile about?"

advice_work 					 : "Who should your work satisfy? What are the criteria used to evaluate your work’s completeness? Knowing the answer to these questions is the key to success. Resist the urge to revise and revise; know when to be happy with your best effort."

advice_spirituality 	 : "Finding your center—a still point, a place of peace insulated from outer disturbances—will help you maintain an enlightened perspective. When pressured or rushed, remember to breathe. Pause, retreat, withdraw. Allow your spiritual discipline to yield practical results."

advice_personal_growth : "A life of constant luxury breeds dullness. Learn when to push back; you can be satisfied with less than you think. With a little restraint in place, you’ll be better equipped to enjoy real luxury when the time for indulgence comes."

advice_fortune_telling : "Whatever you want, you’ll get it."

questions	: ["What outcome would delight you as much as it delights this merchant? What obstacles are in your way?", "In your situation, what information is being hidden or repressed in order to maintain false happiness?", "What kind of outcome could make you this satisfied with your life?", "If I could have anything, what would I have?", "What is my attitude toward luxury? Do I deserve it?"]

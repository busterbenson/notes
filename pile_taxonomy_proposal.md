# Pile Taxonomy Proposal for busterbenson.com

## Executive Summary

**Current State:**
- 154 posts analyzed
- 139 posts with piles (90%)
- 41 unique piles
- Issues: inconsistent specificity, some overlap, missing key themes, misspellings

**Proposal:**
- Reorganize into 4 clear dimensions with ~50 total piles
- More consistent, comprehensive coverage of your themes
- Better balance between specificity and usability

## Problems with Current Taxonomy

1. **Inconsistent Granularity**: "750-words" (very specific) vs. "self-reflection" (very broad)
2. **Type Confusion**: Mix of content types (dialogue, book, fiction) with topics (cognitive-biases, game-theory)
3. **Conceptual Overlap**: behavior-change/mindset, cognitive-biases/critical-thinking, self-tracking/codex-vitae
4. **Spelling Error**: "resiliance" → "resilience"
5. **Missing Key Themes**: philosophy, spirituality, mortality/meaning-making, creativity, identity
6. **Project-Specific Tags**: "750-words", "medium" are too narrow

## Proposed Taxonomy: 4 Dimensions

### **Dimension 1: CONTENT TYPE** (How you're writing)
*What form does the content take?*

- **reflection** - Personal reflections and introspection (replaces: self-reflection)

- **experiment** - Reports on personal experiments
- **guide** - How-to guides and frameworks
- **update** - Project updates and announcements
- **fiction** - Creative fiction (keep)
- **curation** - Link roundups, collections, taxonomies

### **Dimension 2: LIFE DOMAINS** (What area of life)
*Which aspects of human experience?*

## Mapping Changes

### CONSOLIDATIONS
- **self-reflection** → **reflection** (shorter, cleaner)
- **year-in-review** → **year-in-review** (keep as-is)
- **750-words** → **750words** (keep, just remove hyphen for consistency)
- **cognitive-biases** + **critical-thinking** → **cognitive-science** (broader, clearer)
- **mindset** → absorbed into **behavior-change** or **psychology**
- **being-a-creator** → **creativity** + **work**
- **product-management** → **work**
- **personal-mythology** → **identity**
- **rules-to-live-by** → **codex-vitae**
- **quality-time** → **relationships**
- **complaining** → (remove - not useful as ongoing category)
- **book** → **book** (keep as-is - project-specific)
- **fruitful** → **fruitful** (keep as-is - project-specific)
- **medium** → (remove - too specific, use **work** instead)

### FIXES
- **resiliance** → **resilience** (or absorbed into **behavior-change**)

### NEW ADDITIONS
- **philosophy** - Missing despite heavy philosophical content
- **spirituality** - Covers psychedelics, cosmology work, mindfulness
- **identity** - Central theme (masks, authenticity, self-discovery)
- **mortality** - Death as motivator and meaning-maker
- **creativity** - Making things, artistic expression
- **prisoner-dilemma** - Your recent tournament work
- **symbols** - Tarot, symbol languages, meaning systems
- **essay** - For long-form analytical pieces
- **experiment** - For documented experiments
- **guide** - For frameworks and how-tos
- **society** - For Oakland schools, social systems work
- **learning** - Education, teaching, skill development

## Usage Guidelines

### Multiple Piles Encouraged
Most posts should have 2-4 piles from different dimensions:

**Example 1:** "Chalant" year review
- `year-in-review` (content type)
- `reflection` (content type)
- `identity` (life domain)
- `psychology` (intellectual domain)
- `spirituality` (intellectual domain)

**Example 2:** "Cognitive Bias Cheat Sheet"
- `curation` (content type)
- `cognitive-science` (intellectual domain)
- `cognitive-biases` (specific topic)

**Example 3:** "Disconnect Saturdays"
- `experiment` (content type)
- `behavior-change` (intellectual domain)
- `relationships` (life domain)
- `technology` (intellectual domain)

**Example 4:** "Death Bed Game"
- `guide` (content type)
- `self-tracking` (specific topic)
- `mortality` (life domain)
- `behavior-change` (intellectual domain)

### Pile Selection Priority
1. Always add relevant **CONTENT TYPE** pile(s)
2. Add primary **LIFE DOMAIN** pile(s)
3. Add relevant **INTELLECTUAL DOMAIN** pile(s)
4. Add any **SPECIFIC RECURRING TOPICS** that apply

---

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clearer Navigation**: Users can browse by type, domain, or specific interest
2. **Better Discovery**: Related content surfaces through multiple pathways
3. **Future-Proof**: New topics fit into existing dimensions
4. **Consistent Granularity**: Each dimension has similar level of specificity
5. **Reflects Your Thinking**: Honors both systematic frameworks AND personal exploration
6. **Honors Complexity**: Multiple piles capture multi-faceted posts without forcing single categories

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Review & Refine (You do this)
- Review this proposal
- Add/remove/modify piles as needed
- Approve final taxonomy

### Phase 2: Automated Mapping (I'll generate)
- Analyze all 154 posts
- Propose pile assignments based on:
  - Current piles (mapped to new system)
  - Post title analysis
  - Content analysis where available
- Output CSV/JSON for your review

### Phase 3: Your Review & Approval
- Review proposed mappings post-by-post
- Approve, modify, or reject each
- Flag posts that need manual review

### Phase 4: Bulk Update (I'll execute)
- Update all approved post front matter
- Commit changes to git
- Generate summary report

## Questions for You

1. **Dimension clarity**: Do these 4 dimensions make sense? Too many? Too few?
2. **Pile names**: Any naming preferences? (e.g., "year-review" vs "annual-review")
3. **Granularity**: Are the piles at the right level of specificity?
4. **Missing topics**: Any major themes I missed?
5. **750words specificity**: Keep the project-specific pile, or generalize to "projects"?
6. **Multiple piles**: Comfortable with posts having 3-5 piles typically?

## Next Steps

After you review:
1. I'll generate specific pile assignments for all 154 posts
2. Create an interactive review interface (CSV or web-based)
3. You approve/modify the assignments
4. I bulk-update all the files
5. We verify the changes and commit

Let me know your thoughts!

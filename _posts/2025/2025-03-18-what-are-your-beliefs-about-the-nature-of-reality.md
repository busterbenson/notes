## STEP 2: Refine your cosmology

Congrats! You've identified your broad cosmological category from a broad range of possibilities! Now, look for it below and answer one final question to pinpoint your precise view of the cosmos.

### Young Earth Creationism

*Which best describes your perspective on young Earth creationism?*

a. **Biblical Literalism** – You believe in a strict, literal reading of Genesis, with Earth being approximately 6,000-10,000 years old, created in six 24-hour days. You see scientific evidence like radiometric dating or distant starlight as either flawed or created "with age" by God.

b. **Appearance of Age Theory** – You believe God created the universe recently but with the appearance of great age. Just as Adam might have been created as an adult rather than an infant, the entire cosmos was created with a "history" already built in.

c. **Catastrophism** – You believe Earth is young, but its geology has been dramatically shaped by catastrophic events (especially Noah's Flood), which explain phenomena like the fossil record and geological features that scientists attribute to long ages.

### Theistic Evolution

*Which aspect of theistic evolution resonates most with you?*

a. **Evolutionary Creationism** – You believe God created through natural processes, with evolution being God's method of creating biological diversity. Science describes "how" while faith explains "why" and "who." You see no conflict between well-established scientific findings and belief in divine purpose.

b. **Progressive Creation** – You believe God intervened at key moments in Earth's history, particularly to create new "kinds" of life or to guide evolution at critical junctures. While accepting the universe's ancient age, you may be skeptical of some evolutionary mechanisms being sufficient without divine guidance.

c. **Teilhardian Evolution** – Following Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's vision, you see evolution as a divinely guided process moving toward greater complexity and consciousness, ultimately culminating in the "Omega Point" where creation reaches divine unification. Evolution has a spiritual direction, not just a material explanation.

### Deism

*Which form of deism best represents your view?*

a. **Classical Deism** – You believe God created the universe with perfectly designed natural laws and then stepped back, letting it run like a cosmic clock. God neither intervenes nor desires worship; reason and observation of nature are the paths to understanding the Creator.

b. **Modern Deism** – While you believe a creator initiated the universe, you're open to limited divine interaction or periods of involvement. You might accept ideas like a creator who occasionally fine-tunes cosmic parameters or who evolves along with creation.

c. **Scientific Deism** – You see the fundamental laws and constants of physics as evidence of design, particularly their fine-tuning that permits life. Your concept of God is more abstract—perhaps as the ground of mathematics or the source of natural law—rather than a personal being.

### Polytheism

*Which polytheistic framework best reflects your understanding?*

a. **Classical Polytheism** – You believe in multiple distinct deities with different domains, personalities, and powers, similar to ancient traditions like Greek, Norse, or Egyptian pantheons. These gods interact with each other and with humanity in complex ways.

b. **Henotheism** – While acknowledging many gods exist, you primarily worship or connect with one deity, perhaps as your patron or as particularly relevant to your life. Other gods are real but not the focus of your spiritual practice.

c. **Reconstructionist Polytheism** – You practice a revived form of ancient polytheistic religion, attempting to reconstruct historical worship practices while adapting them to contemporary life. You seek authentic connection to ancestral traditions and deities.

d. **Hard Polytheism** – You believe each deity is absolutely distinct, with separate consciousness, will, and essence. Gods are not archetypes or aspects of a single divine force but truly independent beings with their own agendas and personalities.

### Animism

*Which animistic perspective best captures your worldview?*

a. **Traditional Animism** – You believe all things (animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems) possess spirits, consciousness, or personhood, forming a community of beings with agency beyond humans. Proper relationships with these beings involve respect, reciprocity, and ritual acknowledgment.

b. **Neo-Animism** – You've developed a contemporary animistic practice that recognizes consciousness or personhood in natural entities, perhaps blending traditional ideas with modern ecological awareness, phenomenology, or systems thinking.

c. **Panpsychism** – You believe consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe, present to some degree in all things, even at the subatomic level. Rather than separate "spirits," you see consciousness as intrinsic to matter itself, varying in complexity and expression.

### Panentheism

*Which understanding of panentheism most resonates with you?*

a. **Process Panentheism** – Following Alfred North Whitehead and process theology, you believe God and the world are in mutual becoming, with God including yet transcending the universe. God experiences the world and is affected by it, while still maintaining transcendent aspects beyond creation.

b. **Emanationist Panentheism** – You believe the cosmos flows from or emanates from divine reality while remaining within it. Creation is a manifestation of divine energies or aspects, with each level of reality reflecting divine being according to its capacity.

c. **Participatory Panentheism** – You understand the universe as participating in divine reality through consciousness. Through contemplative awareness or mystical experience, beings can recognize their existence within God while acknowledging God's transcendence.

### Pantheism

*Which form of pantheism best describes your view?*

a. **Classical Pantheism** – Following Spinoza, you believe God and Nature are identical—there is only one substance which can be called either "God" or "Nature." Everything that exists is a mode or expression of this single divine reality.

b. **Scientific Pantheism** – You revere the universe and nature as revealed by science, finding spiritual fulfillment in contemplating cosmic evolution, natural beauty, and the laws of physics, without supernatural beliefs. The universe itself is worthy of reverence.

c. **Monistic Pantheism** – You believe all apparent diversity and multiplicity are ultimately illusory; there is only one reality, and that reality is divine. Individual existence is a kind of dream or misperception of the fundamental oneness.

### New Age Spiritualism

*Which New Age path most closely aligns with your perspective?*

a. **Consciousness-Focused** – You believe consciousness creates reality, with thoughts and intentions directly affecting the material world. Practices like the Law of Attraction, manifestation techniques, and visualization are central to your worldview.

b. **Energy-Based** – You focus on subtle energies, chakras, auras, and vibrational frequencies. You might work with crystal healing, Reiki, or other energy modalities, seeing reality as fundamentally vibrational in nature.

c. **Evolutionary Consciousness** – You believe humanity is evolving toward higher consciousness and greater spiritual awareness. We are in a planetary shift (like the Age of Aquarius), where collective awakening will transform society and our relationship with the cosmos.

d. **Eclectic Synthesis** – You draw from multiple spiritual traditions, ancient wisdom, and modern metaphysics, creating a personalized path. You value direct experience over dogma and believe in finding your own truth among many valid perspectives.

### Eastern Mysticism

*Which Eastern tradition most closely reflects your understanding?*

a. **Buddhist Cosmology** – You embrace a worldview centered on emptiness (sunyata) and dependent origination. Ultimate reality has no fixed essence; everything arises interdependently. Through meditation and ethical living, one can realize this truth and attain liberation from suffering.

b. **Advaita Vedanta** – You follow the non-dualistic philosophy that Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (the self) are one. The apparent plurality of existence is maya (illusion), and spiritual practice aims at recognizing your true nature as identical with the divine ground of being.

c. **Taoist Cosmology** – You understand the cosmos through principles of natural balance, flow, and the interplay of opposing yet complementary forces (yin and yang). The Tao is the unnameable source and pattern of existence that operates through non-action (wu-wei).

d. **Yogic/Tantric** – You see the universe as the divine play (lila) of consciousness and energy, with subtle dimensions and channels mirroring cosmic patterns. Through specific practices of breath, visualization, and energy work, you aim to realize unity with cosmic consciousness.

### Gnosticism/Esoteric Dualism

*Which form of Gnostic or dualistic thought resonates most with you?*

a. **Classical Gnosticism** – You believe the material world was created by an imperfect or malevolent Demiurge, not the true God. The divine spark within humans is trapped in matter, and salvation comes through secret knowledge (gnosis) of your divine origins.

b. **Philosophical Dualism** – You see reality as fundamentally divided between mind/spirit and matter, or between good and evil principles. These opposing forces exist in tension, and spiritual progress involves aligning with higher principles against lower ones.

c. **Modern Matrix Skepticism** – You suspect everyday reality is a sophisticated illusion or control system hiding a more fundamental reality. Like the film "The Matrix," our perceived world might be a construction designed to conceal truth from most people.

### Agnostic Spiritual Seeker

*Which approach to spiritual seeking best describes your path?*

a. **Mystical Agnosticism** – You believe in ineffable spiritual reality beyond human comprehension. You value direct mystical experience over doctrine and remain open to moments of transcendence while acknowledging the limitations of language and concepts in capturing the divine.

b. **Pragmatic Spirituality** – You focus on what "works" experientially, valuing practices and ideas that produce positive transformation in your life, regardless of their metaphysical truth claims. Your spirituality is practical and results-oriented.

c. **Philosophical Spirituality** – You approach spiritual questions through philosophical inquiry, valuing rigorous thinking about ultimate reality while remaining open to mystery. You might draw from existentialism, phenomenology, or perennial philosophy.

d. **Transitional Seeking** – You're actively exploring multiple traditions and perspectives, intentionally maintaining uncertainty as you investigate different paths. You see your current agnosticism as a journey rather than a destination.

### Simulation Hypothesis

*Which version of the simulation hypothesis best matches your thinking?*

a. **Technological Simulation** – You believe our reality is a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization (perhaps our own descendants). The laws of physics are computational rules in a sophisticated program running on unimaginably powerful hardware.

b. **Divine Simulation** – You see the simulation as created by a god-like entity, making this perspective similar to certain religious views but framed in technological terms. The "programmer" serves a role analogous to God in traditional theology.

c. **Nested Realities** – You suspect we exist in just one level of many nested simulations, with simulators themselves being simulated. Reality consists of worlds within worlds, with no clear "base reality" accessible to us.

d. **Conscious Simulation** – You believe the simulation isn't computational but consciously generated—more like a vast shared dream or mental construct than a computer program. Reality emerges from consciousness rather than from code.

### Analytic Idealism

*Which aspect of idealism best represents your perspective?*

a. **Kastrupian Dissociation** – Following Bernardo Kastrup, you see the universe as the extrinsic appearance of processes in a universal mind, with individual consciousnesses as "dissociated alters" of this mind, similar to dissociative identity disorder on a cosmic scale.

b. **Quantum Idealism** – You connect idealism with quantum physics, seeing quantum phenomena (observer effects, non-locality, wave function collapse) as evidence that consciousness is fundamental to reality, not an emergent property of matter.

c. **Transcendental Idealism** – Following Kant, you believe the structures of human consciousness shape our experience of reality, making the "thing-in-itself" unknowable. Space, time, and causality are features of consciousness, not objective reality independent of mind.

d. **Neutral Monism** – You believe reality's fundamental nature is neither mental nor physical but a neutral substance that gives rise to both mind and matter as different expressions. Consciousness and physicality are two aspects of the same underlying reality.

### Multiverse Theory

*Which multiverse concept aligns most closely with your understanding?*

a. **Quantum Many-Worlds** – You believe every quantum event creates branch universes where each possible outcome occurs, leading to an infinite array of parallel realities differing in details both small and large. All possibilities exist in some universe.

b. **Inflationary Multiverse** – You accept the cosmological model where our universe is one bubble in an eternally inflating space, with other universe "bubbles" having potentially different physical laws, constants, and dimensions.

c. **Brane Cosmology** – Based on string theory, you believe our universe exists on a membrane ("brane") in higher-dimensional space, with other universes potentially existing on other branes that occasionally interact with ours.

d. **Cyclical Universe** – You believe our universe undergoes endless cycles of expansion and contraction (or similar rebirth patterns), with each cycle potentially having different properties, effectively creating a temporal multiverse.

### Scientific Materialism

*Which form of scientific materialism best describes your perspective?*

a. **Reductive Materialism** – You believe all phenomena, including consciousness, can ultimately be reduced to fundamental physical particles and forces. Everything from thoughts to ecosystems can in principle be explained by physics and chemistry.

b. **Emergent Materialism** – While accepting the physical basis of reality, you recognize that complex systems develop emergent properties not predictable from their components. Consciousness, life, and social phenomena require higher-level explanations beyond particle physics.

c. **Pragmatic Instrumentalism** – You see scientific theories as useful tools for prediction and control rather than literal descriptions of reality. The "truth" of materialism lies in its practical utility, not in metaphysical claims about ultimate reality.

d. **Poetic Naturalism** – Following Sean Carroll's approach, you embrace multiple valid ways of talking about reality at different levels (physical, biological, psychological), all compatible with a fundamental physical world but not reducible to physics in practice.

### Flat Earth Conspiracy

*Which aspect of Earth skepticism best captures your view?*

a. **Biblical Flat Earth** – You believe the Earth is flat primarily based on scriptural descriptions, viewing scientific globe models as contradicting divine revelation and religious authority.

b. **Conspiratorial Flat Earth** – You believe powerful institutions (NASA, governments, scientists) are deliberately hiding the true flat nature of Earth to maintain control, manipulate resources, or advance hidden agendas.

c. **Experiential Flat Earth** – You trust direct sensory experience over scientific claims, noting that the Earth appears flat in everyday observation and questioning evidence for curvature or space-based photography as potentially manipulated.

### Hollow Earth Theory

*Which hollow Earth concept most appeals to you?*

a. **Classic Hollow Earth** – You believe Earth contains vast habitable caverns or a complete interior world, possibly with its own internal sun, advanced civilizations, or entry points near the poles.

b. **Subterranean Civilizations** – You believe advanced beings or lost human civilizations exist in extensive cave systems or artificial structures beneath the surface, interacting occasionally with surface humanity.

c. **Metaphysical Inner Earth** – You see the inner Earth as accessible through altered states of consciousness or vibrational shifting rather than physical entry points, possibly existing in another dimension that intersects with our physical world.

### Electric Universe Theory

*Which aspect of the Electric Universe model most resonates with you?*

a. **Plasma Cosmology** – You believe plasma and electromagnetic forces, rather than gravity, are the dominant shapers of cosmic structures. Galaxies, stars, and planetary features form through electrical scarring and plasma filaments.

b. **Alternative Astrophysics** – You question mainstream explanations for celestial phenomena, believing stars are powered by external electric currents rather than nuclear fusion, and that planets show evidence of massive electrical scarring.

c. **Historical Catastrophism** – You believe Earth experienced catastrophic electrical events in human memory, recorded in ancient myths as battles between gods. Petroglyphs and religious symbols represent plasma formations once visible in the sky.

### Ancient Astronaut Theory

*Which ancient astronaut perspective best matches your beliefs?*

a. **Intervention Origins** – You believe extraterrestrials genetically engineered or modified early humans, explaining the "missing link" in evolution and humanity's rapid cognitive development.

b. **Technological Guidance** – You believe aliens provided advanced knowledge to early civilizations, explaining seemingly impossible ancient achievements like precise megalithic structures or sophisticated astronomical knowledge.

c. **Religious Foundations** – You see major religions as based on misunderstood extraterrestrial contact, with gods actually being advanced aliens, miracles being technology, and religious artifacts (like the Ark of the Covenant) being alien devices.

d. **Ongoing Presence** – You believe ancient astronauts never fully left Earth and continue to monitor or influence human development, possibly from hidden bases or through ongoing genetic programs.

### Indigenous Relational Worldview

*Which aspect of Indigenous cosmology most resonates with your understanding?*

a. **Place-Based Knowledge** – You value deep connection to specific lands and ecosystems, believing that authentic knowledge emerges from generations of relationship with particular places, each with their own needs, spirits, and teachings.

b. **Kinship Cosmology** – You see humans as just one kind of person in a vast family that includes animal persons, plant persons, rock persons, and other beings. Proper living requires maintaining respectful family relationships with all these relatives.

c. **Ceremonial Reality** – You believe ceremony and ritual are not merely symbolic but actively maintain cosmic balance and renew relationships between humans and other-than-human persons, with real consequences for ecological and social wellbeing.

d. **Ancestral Continuity** – You understand time as cyclical rather than linear, with ancestors remaining present and involved in current affairs. Knowledge comes through dreams, visions, and direct communication with ancestral guides.

### Unconventional Skeptic

*Which aspect of alternative thinking best describes your approach?*

a. **Hidden History Researcher** – You focus on investigating suppressed or alternative historical narratives, believing significant events or civilizations have been omitted from mainstream accounts.

b. **Alternative Physics Explorer** – You question fundamental scientific paradigms, suspecting that alternative energy technologies, gravity manipulation, or consciousness-based physical phenomena are possible but suppressed.

c. **Conspiracy Analyst** – You examine potential hidden power structures and deliberate manipulations of public information, looking for patterns that suggest coordinated deception across institutions.

d. **Open Skeptic** – You maintain a stance of questioning both mainstream and alternative explanations, rejecting dogma from all sources while remaining open to possibilities that challenge conventional understanding.

## Results

Based on your answers to the questions in both steps, you now have a refined understanding of your cosmological worldview relative to the other possibilities. Your answers have led you to one of over 50 specific cosmological perspectives that capture the nuances of how you understand the nature of reality. How does it feel?

Your cosmology represents your fundamental assumptions about the universe—its origins, composition, purpose (if any), and your place within it. These beliefs, whether religious, scientific, philosophical, or a blend of traditions, shape how you interpret experiences and make meaning in your life.

Remember that many people hold elements of multiple cosmologies, and views often evolve throughout life. The categories presented here are not rigid boxes but useful frameworks for understanding different ways humans have made sense of existence.

What's most important is not which label fits you, but the ongoing journey of cosmological thinking itself—the human endeavor to comprehend our astonishing universe and our place within it.

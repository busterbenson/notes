I’m playing around with different ways of presenting the results of this tournament. I’ve never really played around with podcast tools, so this is my first foray, and so you’re gonna cringe at the short-cuts I’m taking here. I’m using Riverside.fm, Google Notebook LLM, and suno.com for the intro beeps and boops. I don’t know how to make the transcripts and show notes look nice.

This short episode goes into the pregame commentary, summarizing how Prisoner’s Dilemma works, how this team-based version with AI teams vs a human team will help us discover even more interesting things about collaboration and competition, and they also try to predict how things will go in the first round.

If you listen, let me know what you think and if you have suggestions for how I can prompt Notebook LLM (or another AI) to be better.

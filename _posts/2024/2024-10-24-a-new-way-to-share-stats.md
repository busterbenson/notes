If you go to your stats page after writing 750 words you should now see a new button that starts off by saying “Stats sharing is OFF”. Like this:

If you click that button, you will be given an opportunity to configure your sharing preferences. One of the main things that I never want to change about 750 Words is that the writing is private. So for now the sharing feature will always be turned off by default, and will have to be turned on explicitly for every entry. The idea being that the only time you need to turn sharing on is when you explicitly want to send stats for a specific entry. 

I don’t want things to be shared automatically, and for now I’m also leaving out word clouds from the things that you can share (let me know if you feel strongly about wanting to share word clouds and I might re-consider… the old 750 site did allow it after all). 

When you turn stats sharing on for an entry, it’ll let you choose which parts of the stats page will be public. 

And you can then copy that sharable link and post it to your social media or community or wherever you want. Here’s an example of how that link looks:

A lot of the discussions about this included giving some kind of incentive for people to share. THAT IS COMING! For now, behind the scenes it will track people who click the sharable link and create an account. And I will work on a badge that will be earned when that happens. I wanted to get this out as quickly as possible to get feedback, to make sure this felt okay. And also, if you have ideas for what animal and name the badge should have, please share them! 

Next up will be a way to create a link that goes to your profile and includes more of a “pitch” for 750 Words, and also a slightly more marketing-y treatment. I wanted to start with this first since it’s more of an intrinsic thing to want to share that you wrote, without having to feel like you’re selling something. 

GIMME YOUR FEEDBACK! What do you like? What should be different?

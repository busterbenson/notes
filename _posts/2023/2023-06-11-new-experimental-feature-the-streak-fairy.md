We rolled out a new little feature that has been in testing for a few weeks and could really change the way 750 works. For that reason we're not gonna fully commit to making it a permanent feature yet, but would love for people to try it and let us know what you think. 

The gist of it is that if you miss a day and break your streak, you will have 7 days to make up for the missed day with a "double" day (1,500 words instead of 750). When you do, a little fairy will pop up (where the little pop up usually shows up when you hit 750 words) and offer to repair the day that was missed. If multiple days have been missed within the week, it'll offer this on the oldest of the missed days, and let you slowly patch it forward until the full gap is covered. 

This is a way to fix streaks that doesn't require a streak patch and doesn't require writing in to support and making your case, and yet still (in our opinion) feels pretty fair. We could make it an opt-in kind of thing too if some people don't want it. Give us feedback so we can make it better!

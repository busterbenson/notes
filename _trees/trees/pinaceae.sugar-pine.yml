  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary information
  summary: "The Sugar Pine is the tallest type of pine tree and makes the longest cones of any evergreen tree—up to 20 inches long (longer than your forearm). It's known for being huge, with a straight trunk and graceful branches. It's a famous tree of the Sierra Nevada mountain forests."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Super long cones (10-20 inches, like a banana or longer) hanging from branch tips; needles in bundles of five"
    secondary_markers: "Huge older trees with straight trunks; branches that stick out straight then droop at the tips"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green all year; giant cones ripen in late summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Western White Pine, has much longer cones; unlike Ponderosa Pine, has needles in bundles of five, not three"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super long cones - the longest of any pine tree!"
    memorable_comparison: "The giant cones can be longer than your forearm and look like banana-shaped ornaments hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "Count the needles in each bundle - if you find five needles growing together like a little star, it might be a Sugar Pine"
    smell_tip: "The sticky sap smells sweet like maple syrup or cotton candy (but don't touch or taste it - it's super sticky and might cause itchy skin!)"
    fun_fact: "People who lived here long ago called it the 'sugar tree' because the dried sap tastes sweet! John Muir, a famous nature explorer, called it the 'king of the pines' and would eat small bits of the crystallized sap like candy during his mountain adventures."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look for really long cones (as long as your arm from elbow to fingertips) hanging from branches or on the ground"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Sugar Pine - look for other pine trees with shorter cones"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Grab a needle bundle and count - are there exactly 5 needles in each bunch?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Sugar Pine - if there are 2 or 3 needles in each bunch, it's a different pine tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree very tall with a straight trunk and branches that stick out sideways with droopy tips?"
        yes_next: "You found a Sugar Pine!"
        no_next: "Might be Western White Pine, which has shorter cones (about as long as your hand)"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth emerges, lighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small yellow pollen bumps release yellow dust; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches grow new baby needles that are brighter green"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles grow to full size and darken; young cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones growing but still green and closed"
      identification_tips: "Look for green developing cones hanging from branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the giant cones start growing - they're still green and not as big as they'll get"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles on the inside turn yellow and drop; cones turn brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones turn brown but usually stay closed until next year"
      identification_tips: "Look for brown mature cones; some needle drop but tree stays mostly green"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the giant cones turn brown and get ready to drop their seeds"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree stays green; may lose some older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Resting; mature cones may stay on the tree through winter"
      identification_tips: "Massive, straight trunk and spreading branches stand out in winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Sugar Pines stay green and you can still see their giant cones hanging like Christmas decorations"

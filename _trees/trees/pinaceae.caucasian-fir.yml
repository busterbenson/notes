    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Is it a perfect triangle (pyramid) shape with evenly spaced branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the tree has a different shape, it's probably not a Caucasian Fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the needles grow. Are they flat and arranged in neat rows along both sides of the branches like a comb?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles stick out all around the branch or grow in bundles, it's not a Caucasian Fir"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently turn over a needle. Can you see two white lines on the underside?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If there are no white lines on the needle undersides, try checking for Noble Fir or Grand Fir"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If there are cones, do they stand upright on the branches (not hanging down)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Caucasian Fir!"
        no_next: "If the cones hang down, it's not a fir tree - check for spruce or hemlock"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A multi-stemmed, shrubby maple that sometimes grows into a small tree. Has distinctively lobed leaves with sharp teeth, opposite branching, and bright red twigs. Often grows in cool mountain areas, turning yellow to red in fall."
  
  # Identification priority path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Multi-stemmed shrub or small tree with bright red twigs; opposite branches; leaves with 3-5 pointed lobes and sharp teeth"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark; paired helicopter-like seeds; yellow to red fall color"
    seasonal_markers: "Small greenish-yellow flowers in spring; bright red twigs visible year-round; brilliant fall colors"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small, bushy maple with bright red twigs and leaves with pointed fingers"
    memorable_comparison: "Like a maple that never grew up - it stays small and bushy, often with red twigs that look like they've been painted"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel thin and papery with bumpy veins; the twigs are smooth and sometimes reddish"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to release a mild, sweet smell"
    fun_fact: "Rocky Mountain Maple is a superhero tree! Its bright red twigs can protect themselves from getting sunburned - they make their own natural sunscreen by turning red in the sun!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if it's a small, bushy tree or shrub with multiple stems from the ground. Does it look more like a big bush than a tree with one trunk?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it has a single trunk, it might be Canyon Maple or another maple species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the branches grow. Do they grow in pairs directly opposite each other on the stem?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If branches alternate sides, it's not a maple - check other shrubs"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Do they have 3-5 pointed 'fingers' (lobes) with sharp teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If leaves aren't lobed like a hand with teeth, it might be another shrub"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the twigs, especially new growth. Are many of them reddish, particularly where they get lots of sun?"
        yes_next: "You found a Rocky Mountain Maple!"
        no_next: "If twigs aren't reddish and the plant is larger, check Canyon Maple or other maples"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Canyon Maple (Acer grandidentatum)"
      differences: "Canyon Maple typically grows as a single-trunked small tree rather than a multi-stemmed shrub; has larger leaves"
      identification_tip: "Rocky Mountain Maple is usually shrubby with multiple stems; Canyon Maple typically has a single trunk"
    - species: "Bigleaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum)"
      differences: "Bigleaf Maple has much larger leaves (8-12 inches across) and grows into a large tree (up to 100 feet tall)"

    - species: "Mountain Ninebark (Physocarpus monogynus)"
      differences: "Mountain Ninebark has alternate (not opposite) branches and leaves with shallower lobes"
      identification_tip: "Check the branching pattern - if branches alternate instead of growing in pairs, it's not Rocky Mountain Maple"
      
  seasonal_timeline:

  family: "Cupressaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tough, drought-resistant evergreen tree with shreddy reddish-brown bark and tiny, scale-like blue-green leaves. It has a twisted, gnarly shape when old and produces small, berry-like blue cones. Native to dry, high-elevation areas of California and the Great Basin."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Twisted, gnarly growth form; shreddy reddish-brown bark that peels in strips; tiny scale-like blue-green leaves"
    secondary_markers: "Round, berry-like blue seed cones; strong, spicy smell when leaves are crushed; often grows in dry, rocky areas"
    seasonal_markers: "Blue 'berries' (actually cones) in late summer and fall; same appearance year-round as it's evergreen"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike California Juniper, has larger berry-like cones and grows at higher elevations; unlike Sierra Juniper, has a single trunk rather than multiple trunks"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Twisted, gnarly tree with shreddy reddish bark and tiny scale-like leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a tree from a fairy tale that's been twisted by the wind, with bark that peels like cinnamon sticks"
    touch_tip: "Feel the scaly leaves - they're prickly but not as sharp as pine needles"
    smell_tip: "Rub the leaves gently between your fingers to smell a strong, spicy scent like a Christmas wreath"
    fun_fact: "Western Junipers can live over 1,000 years! The oldest ones are older than castles, and Native Americans used their berries for medicine and to flavor food."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape. Is it twisted and gnarly like a tree from a magical story?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Western Juniper - look for another tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling off in strips like cinnamon?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of juniper or cedar - look at the leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap, covering the twigs like tiny green dragon scales?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a juniper - check if it has needles or flat leaves instead"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Gently rub some leaves between your fingers and smell. Does it have a strong, spicy smell?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "Might be a different kind of evergreen tree with scale leaves"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "If it's fall, look for blue berry-like cones. Can you find any?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Juniper!"
        no_next: "Look at where you are - if you're in a dry, rocky area in the mountains of eastern California, it's probably a Western Juniper"

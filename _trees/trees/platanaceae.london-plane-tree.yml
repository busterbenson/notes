  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A large deciduous tree with distinctive camouflage-patterned bark that peels in patches to reveal cream, green, and tan colors underneath. It has large, maple-like leaves with 3-5 lobes and produces round, spiky seed balls that hang from branches. This hybrid tree is extremely popular for urban settings due to its tolerance of pollution, compacted soil, and pruning."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Mottled bark that peels in patches revealing multiple colors; large maple-like leaves with 3-5 pointed lobes; round, spiky seed balls hanging from branches"
    secondary_markers: "Very tall with widespread canopy; seeds balls often hanging in pairs or groups; flaking bark creates camouflage pattern"
    seasonal_markers: "Round seed balls persist through winter; vibrant yellow-brown fall color; distinctive peeling bark visible year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Similar to American Sycamore but with more deeply lobed leaves and usually two seed balls per stem instead of one; similar leaf shape to maples but with alternate not opposite arrangement"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Bark that peels like puzzle pieces showing cream, green, and brown colors underneath, like camouflage"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's playing hide-and-seek with its camouflage pattern bark, and the seed balls look like tiny spiky planets hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel rough like sandpaper; the bark feels smooth where it has freshly peeled"
    smell_tip: "Crushing a leaf might give a faint earthy smell, but nothing strong or special"
    fun_fact: "London Plane Trees were planted all over London and other big cities because they could survive in smoky, polluted air when other trees would die. The peeling bark helps the tree clean itself by shedding dirt and pollution!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Does it peel in patches showing cream, green, and brown colors underneath, creating a camouflage pattern?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a London Plane Tree - try looking at trees with different bark patterns"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves (if present). Are they large, maple-like with 3-5 pointed lobes, growing alternately (not in pairs)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a London Plane Tree - if the leaves grow in pairs directly opposite each other, it might be a maple"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check for round, spiky seed balls hanging from branches (especially visible in late summer through winter)"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's early in the season, the seed balls might not be formed yet. Look for the distinctive camouflage bark."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree very large, often planted along streets or in parks?"
        yes_next: "You found a London Plane Tree!"
        no_next: "If it's a smaller tree, it might be young or a different species"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "American Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis)"
      differences: "American Sycamore has less deeply lobed leaves; usually one seed ball per stem instead of pairs; tends to have more cream/white showing in bark"
      identification_tip: "If the seed balls grow singly (not in pairs) and the leaves have shallow lobes, it's likely an American Sycamore"
    - species: "California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa)"
      differences: "California Sycamore has deeper spaces between leaf lobes; seed balls in strings of 3-7 instead of pairs; grows more irregularly"
      identification_tip: "If the seed balls hang in strings of several (not pairs) and the tree has a more irregular shape, it's a California Sycamore"
    - species: "Maple Trees (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maples have opposite leaves (pairs directly across from each other); produce winged seed pairs ('helicopters'); don't have peeling, camouflage bark"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves grow in pairs directly opposite each other, it's a maple, not a plane tree"

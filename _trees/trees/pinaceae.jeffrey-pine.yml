  common_name: "Jeffrey Pine"
  scientific_name: "Pinus jeffreyi"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary information
  summary: "The Jeffrey Pine is a tall evergreen tree with long needles in bundles of three and large, spiky cones that smell like vanilla or butterscotch when sniffed. It has puzzle-piece bark and grows mostly in the mountains of California, Oregon, and Nevada."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of three; cones with outward-pointing prickles that don't hurt when touched; bark smells like vanilla or butterscotch when sniffed"
    secondary_markers: "Puzzle-piece bark pattern; large 5-10 inch cones; straight tall trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays green year-round; pollen cones in spring; seed cones mature in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Ponderosa Pine, has vanilla-scented bark and gentler cone prickles; unlike Sugar Pine, has needles in threes not fives; unlike Coulter Pine, has smaller, gentler cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Vanilla-scented bark and gentle cone prickles"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like puzzle pieces and smells like vanilla ice cream or butterscotch candy"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch a cone - the prickles bend easily under your finger, unlike Ponderosa Pine's sharp prickles"
    smell_tip: "Scratch a small spot on the bark and sniff - you might smell vanilla or butterscotch (but don't scratch a lot!)"
    fun_fact: "Jeffrey Pine's cones are sometimes called 'gentle giants' because they're big but their prickles are soft enough to touch. Early settlers called these 'sweet-smelling pines' because of their wonderful vanilla smell!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, count the needles in a bundle. Do you find exactly 3 needles growing together in each group?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Jeffrey Pine - if there are 5 needles per bundle, check Sugar Pine; if 2 needles, check other pines"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Find a cone on the tree or ground. Can you touch the prickles without them hurting your finger?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the prickles are very sharp and hurt, it's probably a Ponderosa Pine"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently scratch and sniff the bark. Does it smell like vanilla ice cream or butterscotch?"
        yes_next: "You found a Jeffrey Pine!"
        no_next: "If the bark doesn't smell sweet, check if it's a Ponderosa Pine, which sometimes smells like turpentine"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears, often slightly lighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small purple-red pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth and pollen production"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, new needles grow and the tree makes yellow pollen that can blow in the wind like dust"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles reach full size, color darkens; young seed cones growing"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones continue developing, remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Green developing cones visible, about the size of your fist"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Baby cones are growing in summer - they're green and shiny, about the size of a baseball"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles yellow and fall; cones begin to ripen and open"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature, turn brown, and open to release seeds with wings"
      identification_tips: "Look for open or opening brown cones with winged seeds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown and open up like flowers to let their seeds fly away"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree remains green; empty opened cones may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive form and bark visible; opened cones may persist"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Jeffrey Pines stay green when other trees lose their leaves"

tree:
  common_name: "Silver Dollar Gum"
  scientific_name: "Eucalyptus polyanthemos"
  family: "Myrtaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized evergreen tree with distinctive round, silver-blue leaves that resemble coins or silver dollars. It has smooth, mottled bark that peels in patches to reveal gray, cream, and light brown colors, and produces small white flowers followed by tiny round seed capsules."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Round, silver-blue leaves that keep their coin-like shape even when mature; smooth bark in patches of gray, cream, and brown"
    secondary_markers: "Moderate size with spreading canopy; mint-like eucalyptus smell when leaves are crushed; small round seed capsules"
    seasonal_markers: "Clusters of small white flowers in spring to early summer; bark peeling most active in summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Blue Gum Eucalyptus, has smaller, rounded leaves that stay round when mature and grows much smaller; unlike Red Gum Eucalyptus, has rounder, more silver-colored leaves"

        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they round like coins and silver-blue in color?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Silver Dollar Gum - if the leaves are long and narrow, check other eucalyptus trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the size of the tree. Is it medium-sized (about as tall as a two-story house) with a rounded shape?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it's very tall (like a 10-story building), it might be a different eucalyptus"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a eucalyptus smell like mint or cough drops?"
        yes_next: "You found a Silver Dollar Gum!"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous tree with shiny reddish-brown to black bark that peels in thin horizontal strips. It has small, ovate to triangular leaves with sharp double-toothed edges and produces slender cylindrical catkins. Native to mountainous stream banks and wet areas in western North America, including parts of California."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree that grows near water with shiny dark bark that peels in thin strips like paper"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like thin sheets of shiny dark chocolate that are peeling off the tree"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels smooth and papery where it's peeling, and you can sometimes carefully peel a small piece yourself"
    smell_tip: "If you crush a leaf gently, it has a mild, pleasant scent"
    fun_fact: "Water Birch trees are like nature's water markers! They show you where to find water in mountains and forests. Native Americans and early settlers would look for these trees when they needed to find drinking water!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look where the tree is growing. Is it right next to a stream, river, or in a wet area in the mountains?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Water Birch - they almost always grow near water in mountainous areas"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it dark reddish-brown to black and peeling in thin strips like peeling paper?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another kind of tree - try looking at alders or willows instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they small, oval to triangular-shaped with jagged teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Water Birch - check for other trees that grow near water"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree fairly small (about the size of a big bush to a single-story house) with several trunks coming from the base?"
        yes_next: "You found a Water Birch!"
        no_next: "If it's spring, look for long, dangling catkins. If it's a large tree with white bark, it might be a different kind of birch."

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright yellow before dropping; seed catkins mature and begin to release tiny winged seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed catkins break apart and release seeds that are carried by wind"
      identification_tips: "Bright yellow fall color; dark bark with horizontal lenticels (small lines); cylindrical seed catkins"

    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; distinctive dark bark remains visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins for next spring begin to form late in winter"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Star-shaped leaves with 5-7 pointed lobes, often in beautiful colors like red or purple"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like tiny red or green stars with pointy tips"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's thin and delicate, like paper, with little points all around the edge"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently and smell - it has a light, fresh scent"
    fun_fact: "There are over 1,000 different types of Japanese maples, with leaves ranging from normal green to bright red, deep purple, and even types with pink and white patches!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the size. Is it a small tree or large shrub, usually not taller than a two-story house?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a Japanese Maple - they're usually small trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they star-shaped with 5-7 pointy lobes like a pointy hand?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Japanese Maple - check trees with star-shaped leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow on the branch. Do they grow directly opposite each other, not in a zigzag pattern?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Japanese Maple - they have opposite leaves"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the leaf color. Is it red, purple, or green (sometimes with red edges)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Japanese Maple!"
        no_next: "Might not be a Japanese Maple - they typically have green, red, or purple leaves"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Other Maple Species (Acer species)"
      differences: "Other maples are typically much larger trees; have less deeply cut leaf lobes; usually only have green leaves during growing season"
      identification_tip: "If it's a large tree with less fancy, mostly green leaves, it's probably a different maple species"
    - species: "Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua)"
      differences: "Has star-shaped leaves but they are arranged alternately (not opposite); produces spiky ball-like fruits"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves aren't directly across from each other on the twig, or if you see spiky ball fruits, it's sweetgum not Japanese maple"
    - species: "Red-Leaf Varieties of Other Trees"
      differences: "Other red-leaf trees like purple leaf plum have different leaf shapes; not star-like with multiple pointed lobes"
      identification_tip: "Check the leaf shape - Japanese maples have distinct star-shaped leaves with 5-7 pointed lobes"
      
  seasonal_timeline:

    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaf color may deepen or fade depending on variety and sun exposure"
      reproductive_activity: "Develops paired winged seeds (samaras)"

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Spectacular color change to bright reds, oranges, or yellows"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and may begin to drop"
      identification_tips: "Fall color is a key identifier"

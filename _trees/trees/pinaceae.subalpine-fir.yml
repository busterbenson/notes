  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A skinny Christmas tree that grows on high mountaintops with a very pointy top"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a rocket ship or church steeple with its super narrow, pointy shape"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel soft, not prickly, and they're crowded together like lots of tiny green fingers pointing up"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle to smell a sweet Christmas tree scent"
    fun_fact: "Subalpine Fir trees are mountain climbers! They grow higher up mountains than almost any other tree in California - sometimes right at the edge where trees can't grow any higher. They're shaped like a narrow rocket ship to shed snow and survive fierce mountain winds!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where you are. Are you high in the mountains, near where trees stop growing (treeline)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If you're in lower forests or valleys, it's probably not a Subalpine Fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape. Does it have a very narrow, spire-like shape with a skinny, pointed top?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it has a broader or rounded crown, it might be a different kind of fir or spruce"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they short (about 1 inch), flat, and do they curve upward around the twig?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If needles are long, sharp, or arranged in a flat spray, it might be a different evergreen tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If you can see them, do the cones stand upright on branches (not hang down) and have a dark purple color?"
        yes_next: "You found a Subalpine Fir!"
        no_next: "If cones hang down or the tree doesn't match these features, it might be another mountain evergreen"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Pacific Silver Fir (Abies amabilis)"
      differences: "Pacific Silver Fir has a broader crown, longer needles, and typically grows at lower elevations than Subalpine Fir"
      identification_tip: "Subalpine Fir has a much narrower, spire-like crown and a more distinctly pointed top"
    - species: "Mountain Hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana)"
      differences: "Mountain Hemlock has a drooping leader (top), hanging cones, and needles primarily arranged to sides of twigs"
      identification_tip: "Subalpine Fir has a straight, pointed top and upright cones; hemlock often has a drooping top"
    - species: "Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii)"
      differences: "Engelmann Spruce has square, sharp needles that can be rolled between fingers and hanging cones"
      identification_tip: "Gently roll a needle - Subalpine Fir needles are flat and won't roll; spruce needles are square and will roll easily"
      
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright bluish-green new growth appears at branch tips; pollen is released from small pollen cones"
      reproductive_activity: "Male pollen cones release yellow pollen; tiny purplish female cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "New growth contrasts with older, darker needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches grow new blue-green baby needles that are softer than the older ones"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures; upright dark purple cones develop on upper branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow and mature, remaining upright on branches"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive upright purple cones are excellent identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see dark purple cones standing up like birthday candles on the upper branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No change in needle color; cones mature and begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones break apart on the tree to release seeds; they disintegrate rather than falling whole"
      identification_tips: "Cone scales fall to the ground, leaving only the central axis on the tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the purple cones break apart like puzzles while still on the tree, dropping their pieces to the ground"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; narrow spire shape sheds snow effectively"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; cone axes may remain visible on branches"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive narrow spire shape stands out in snowy landscapes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, snow slides off its skinny, rocket-ship shape, and it stays green when many other plants are bare"

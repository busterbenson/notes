  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Colorful peeling bark that looks like puzzle pieces in oranges, grays, greens, and browns"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like someone started peeling off stickers or puzzle pieces to reveal different colors underneath"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth and small the leaves are - they're glossy like they've been polished"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the bark has a subtle woody scent"
    fun_fact: "Chinese Elm trees are sometimes called 'lacebark elms' because their peeling bark reveals a pattern that looks like colorful lace! They're also super tough trees that can live for hundreds of years, even in city pollution that makes other trees sick."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Does it have colorful patches where it's peeling, with orange, brown, gray, and greenish colors showing through?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is solid gray or brown without colorful patches, it's probably a different elm species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they small (about the size of your thumb or a bit bigger), dark green, and shiny?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are large, rough, or dull, check for American Elm or Cedar Elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the tree shape. Does it have a graceful vase shape with branches that arch upward and outward?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "It still might be a Chinese Elm - especially if it's young. Check the colorful peeling bark again"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's winter in a mild area, does the tree still have some of its leaves when other trees are bare?"
        yes_next: "You found a Chinese Elm!"
        no_next: "It could still be a Chinese Elm, especially if the weather is cold. Look at the colorful peeling bark"

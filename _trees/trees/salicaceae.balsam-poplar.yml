  # Basic summary
  summary: "A tall, fast-growing deciduous tree with oval to lance-shaped leaves that have a whitish underside. Known for its very aromatic, sticky leaf buds in spring, smooth grayish bark that develops furrows with age, and fluffy white seeds that float through the air."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Very fragrant, sticky leaf buds, especially in spring; oval to lance-shaped leaves (longer than they are wide) with whitish undersides"
    secondary_markers: "Leaves flutter in the breeze due to flattened leaf stems; smooth gray-green bark on younger trees that becomes furrowed with age"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright yellow fall color; extremely sticky and sweet-smelling buds in early spring; hanging catkins before leaves emerge"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Quaking Aspen, has more elongated leaves (not rounded); unlike Fremont Cottonwood, leaves are more oval/elongated than triangular; similar to Balm-of-Gilead but with more elongated leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super-sticky, sweet-smelling buds in spring, and oval, pointed leaves with silver undersides that flutter in the wind"
    memorable_comparison: "The sticky buds feel like nature's super glue and smell like sweet honey mixed with cough drops"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf stem - it's flat instead of round, which is why the leaves dance in the breeze. In spring, carefully touch a bud - it's super sticky like syrup!"
    smell_tip: "In spring, carefully smell the sticky buds - they have an amazing sweet, balsam smell that people use in perfumes and medicines"
    fun_fact: "The super fragrant sticky stuff on the buds is called 'resin' and was collected by Native Americans and pioneers to make medicine for sore throats and chest colds. That's why it's called 'Balsam' Poplar!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the leaf shape - are they oval to lance-shaped (longer than wide) with pointed tips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Balsam Poplar - if they're more triangular or round, check other poplar species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Flip over a leaf - is the underside whitish or silvery?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Balsam Poplar"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In spring, check the buds - are they super sticky and smell sweet like honey or cough drops?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's spring and the buds aren't very sticky and fragrant, it's probably not a Balsam Poplar"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Make the 'wind test' - do the leaves dance and make noise even in a light breeze?"
        yes_next: "You found a Balsam Poplar!"
        no_next: "If the leaves don't flutter easily, it might be another tree species"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Very sticky, fragrant buds open; hanging catkins appear before leaves fully emerge; leaves unfold with whitish undersides; females produce green seed capsules that later release cottony seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Male trees produce reddish-purple hanging catkins; female trees produce greenish catkins that develop into seed capsules"
      identification_tips: "This is the best time to identify by the extremely aromatic sticky buds and catkins"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Spring is the best time to smell the amazing sweet, sticky buds - they're like nature's perfume factory!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of oval, pointed green leaves with white undersides that shimmer in the wind; cottony seed dispersal ends"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds have already been released; tree focuses on growing"
      identification_tips: "Look for oval to lance-shaped leaves with white undersides that flutter in the breeze"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, watch how the leaves flip over and look silvery when the wind blows, making a soft rustling sound"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright golden yellow; eventually all leaves fall off for winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree prepares for dormancy; next year's buds begin to form"
      identification_tips: "The golden yellow fall color and oval-shaped leaves are good identifiers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the tree turns bright yellow like it's made of gold before dropping all its leaves"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; bark more visible; sticky, fragrant buds visible on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds getting ready for spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for the large, very sticky winter buds and grayish bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the shiny, sticky buds on the bare branches - they're already making the sweet smell for spring"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Balm-of-Gilead Poplar (Populus Ã— jackii)"
      differences: "Balm-of-Gilead is actually a hybrid with Balsam Poplar as one parent; it has more heart-shaped, less elongated leaves; extremely similar otherwise"
      identification_tip: "These are very hard to tell apart - Balsam Poplar leaves are more elongated (oval to lance-shaped) with less rounded bases"

      differences: "Eastern Cottonwood has more triangular leaves with a straight or slightly curved base; buds are aromatic but not as strongly scented"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are more triangular with straight bases and the buds are less sticky and fragrant, it might be Eastern Cottonwood"
    
    - species: "Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides)"
      differences: "Quaking Aspen has rounded leaves (not oval/elongated); buds are much less sticky and aromatic; typically smaller overall size"

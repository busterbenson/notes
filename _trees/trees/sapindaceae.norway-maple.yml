  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium to large deciduous tree with broad, 5-7 lobed leaves that have few teeth and pointed tips. The most distinctive feature is the milky white sap that oozes out when a leaf stem is broken. Norway Maple creates dense shade with its rounded crown and produces paired winged seeds with wings spread at a wide angle."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Milky white sap when leaf stem is broken; broad 5-7 lobed leaves with pointed tips and few teeth"
    secondary_markers: "Dense, rounded crown; opposite leaf arrangement; paired winged seeds with wings spread at nearly 180 degrees"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow-green flower clusters in spring that stand upright; yellow fall color; large, rounded, purplish buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike other maples, produces milky sap when leaf stem is broken; unlike Sugar Maple, has pointed rather than rounded notches between lobes; unlike Red Maple, has broader leaves with fewer teeth"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Milky white sap that comes out when you carefully break a leaf stem"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaf shape looks like a hand with broad, pointy fingers, wider than other maple leaves"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth with only a few teeth around the edges"
    smell_tip: "The leaf doesn't have a strong smell, but the white sap is sticky"
    fun_fact: "Norway Maple trees create such deep shade that often nothing grows underneath them - they're like nature's umbrellas!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the leaves grow on the twigs. Do they grow directly across from each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Norway Maple - their leaves always grow opposite each other"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Does it have 5-7 pointed lobes that are broad (not skinny and deeply cut)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another maple - Norway Maple has broad, less deeply cut lobes"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Carefully break a leaf stem (petiole). Does white, milky sap come out (like watery milk)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Norway Maple - the milky sap is a key identifier"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree creating very dense shade underneath it, and does it have a rounded crown?"
        yes_next: "You found a Norway Maple!"
        no_next: "Might still be a Norway Maple, but check other features carefully"

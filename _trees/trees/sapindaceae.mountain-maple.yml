  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small, multi-stemmed understory tree or large shrub with three-lobed leaves, reddish twigs, and striking red fall foliage. Native to northeastern North America, it thrives in cool, moist mountain forests and along streams, rarely exceeding 25 feet in height."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small, multi-stemmed deciduous tree with 3-lobed (occasionally 5-lobed) leaves; opposite branching pattern; leaves with coarse, irregular teeth"
    secondary_markers: "Upright clusters of small greenish-yellow flowers in late spring; paired winged seeds (samaras) turning red before brown at maturity; red twigs"
    seasonal_markers: "Brilliant red to orange fall color; flowers appear after leaves emerge in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Rocky Mountain Maple, has more distinctly 3-lobed leaves with coarser teeth; unlike Vine Maple, has more erect growth form and less deeply cut leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:

    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they have bumpy veins and rough teeth around the edges"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf to smell a faint sweet scent"
    fun_fact: "Mountain Maple's seeds turn bright red before they're fully ripe - like they're blushing! Later they turn brown and twirl down to the ground like little helicopters."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the overall size. Is it a small tree or large shrub with multiple stems growing from the base?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Mountain Maple - check other maple species that grow larger"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the branches and leaves grow. Do they grow in pairs directly across from each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a maple - look for trees with leaves that alternate along the branch"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Do they have 3 main pointed lobes (sometimes 5) with jagged teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another maple species - check shape of lobes and leaf size"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the leaves turning bright red? In spring or summer, can you find pairs of winged seeds (samaras) that may be reddish?"
        yes_next: "You found a Mountain Maple!"
        no_next: "Look at the twigs - Mountain Maple often has reddish twigs, especially new growth"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge with a reddish tint before turning green; upright clusters of small greenish-yellow flowers appear after leaves unfold"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom in late spring, typically May to June"
      identification_tips: "Look for emerging leaves with 3 distinct lobes and flower clusters forming at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the new leaves that might be a bit reddish at first, and then small bunches of yellowish-green flowers"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full dark green color; winged seed pairs develop, often turning red before maturing to brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds develop throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Look for paired samaras (winged seeds) that often have a reddish color during development"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the leaves are deep green and you'll see pairs of seeds forming - they often look red before turning brown"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn brilliant red to orange; seeds mature and disperse"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds fully mature and are dispersed by wind"
      identification_tips: "The brilliant red fall color is distinctive; mature seeds spin to the ground like helicopters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when Mountain Maple puts on its best show - with bright red leaves and helicopter seeds spinning down"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Drops all leaves; reddish twigs and opposite branching pattern stand out"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Look for opposite branching pattern, multiple stems, and often reddish twigs"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the reddish twigs with opposite buds - they grow in pairs facing each other"

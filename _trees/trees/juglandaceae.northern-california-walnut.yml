  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Feathery compound leaves with many toothed leaflets along a central stem, and round nuts with super thick, hard shells"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaf looks like a green feather with many small leaflets, and the nuts are like tiny round soccer balls with thick armor"
    touch_tip: "Feel the rough, deeply grooved bark - it looks and feels like deep channels carved through gray tree skin"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently and smell the spicy aroma - it smells a bit like furniture polish!"
    fun_fact: "This tree's wood is extremely beautiful with swirling patterns and dark colors. It was once so prized for making fancy furniture and gun handles that it was nearly harvested to extinction! Now, it's mostly used as rootstock to grow English walnuts because it's resistant to diseases."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have many small leaflets (13-21) arranged along a central stem like a feather?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Northern California Walnut - look for trees with simple leaves or different compound leaf patterns"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for nuts on or under the tree (in summer and fall). Are they round with thick, hard shells (not the thinner-shelled nuts you buy in the store)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Check the bark pattern next - if there are no nuts visible"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it rough with deep grooves that form a criss-cross pattern?"
        yes_next: "You found a Northern California Walnut! Crush a leaf gently and smell the spicy scent to confirm."
        no_next: "If the bark is smooth or has a different pattern, it might be another type of tree."

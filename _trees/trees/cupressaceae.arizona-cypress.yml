tree:
  common_name: "Arizona Cypress"
  scientific_name: "Cupressus arizonica"
  family: "Cupressaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences)
  summary: "A medium-sized evergreen tree with blue-gray or silver-gray scale-like leaves and shreddy reddish-brown bark. It has a dense, pyramid-shaped crown when young that becomes more irregular with age. Native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, it's widely planted in California landscapes."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-gray to silver-gray scale-like leaves; shreddy reddish-brown bark; round woody cones about the size of a marble"
    secondary_markers: "Dense pyramid shape when young; strong cedar-like scent when foliage is crushed; small bumps (glands) on the back of scale leaves"
    seasonal_markers: "No major seasonal changes as it stays evergreen year-round; woody cones persist on branches"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Bluer foliage than many other cypresses; unlike Italian Cypress, has a broader pyramid shape rather than narrow column; unlike Monterey Cypress, has more blue-gray rather than bright green foliage"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue-gray or silver-gray scale-like leaves and shreddy reddish-brown bark"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a Christmas tree wearing a silvery-blue costume with reddish-brown bark that peels like cinnamon sticks"
    touch_tip: "The foliage feels softer than most evergreens, not prickly, and the bark feels rough and shaggy"
    smell_tip: "Gently rub the leaves to smell a strong, spicy scent like cedar chest wood"
    fun_fact: "Arizona Cypress can survive in super hot, dry places that would kill most other trees! Its blue-gray color actually helps reflect sunlight to keep it cooler in the desert heat."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's color from a distance. Does it have blue-gray or silvery foliage that stands out from other trees?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not an Arizona Cypress - check other cypress or juniper trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling off in thin, shreddy strips?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another blue-colored evergreen - check blue spruce or some junipers"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like fish scales rather than needles?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not an Arizona Cypress - check if it has needles instead of scales"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Gently rub some leaves and smell your fingers. Do they have a strong, spicy cedar smell?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "Might be a different cypress or cedar - check for other identifying features"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "Look for small round woody cones about the size of a marble. Can you find any on the tree or on the ground below?"
        yes_next: "You found an Arizona Cypress!"
        no_next: "If the tree has all other features but no cones, it still might be an Arizona Cypress, especially if it's young or recently pruned"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth at branch tips may be slightly lighter blue-green"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny male pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "Look for small yellow pollen cones that release pollen when touched"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, some branches might have tiny yellow bumps that puff out yellow dust (pollen) if you tap them - but don't breathe it in!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Consistent blue-gray color; young cones start growing"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones grow and start to develop"
      identification_tips: "Young green cones visible on some branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "The tree stays blue-gray and you might see small green round bumps starting to grow - these are baby cones"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change; seed cones begin to mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones start turning from green to brown"
      identification_tips: "Cones changing from green to woody brown"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees change color, this one stays the same blue-gray shade, and the little green cones turn brown like tiny wooden balls"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No change from fall; keeps all its foliage"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones may open during dry periods to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature stands out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "This tree keeps its blue-gray 'clothes' on all winter while other trees lose their leaves"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A stately deciduous tree with distinctive smooth, silver-gray 'elephant skin' bark that remains smooth even in old age. Features oval leaves with wavy edges and straight parallel veins extending to small teeth. Native to Europe but planted as an ornamental tree in California, with purple-leaved varieties being especially popular in landscapes."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Smooth, silver-gray bark that remains smooth even on large, old trees; oval leaves with wavy edges and straight, parallel veins extending to small teeth; pointed, cigar-shaped buds in winter"
    secondary_markers: "Triangular nuts in bristly husks; purple-leaved varieties common in landscapes; dense, dome-shaped crown creating deep shade"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright green (or purple) new growth in spring; deep green (or purple) summer foliage; yellow to coppery bronze fall color; smooth bark visible year-round with distinctive cigar-shaped buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American beech, has smaller leaves with more wavy edges and less pronounced teeth; unlike hornbeam, bark remains smooth throughout life and never becomes fluted; unlike birches, does not have peeling bark"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, elephant-skin gray bark that stays smooth even on big trees, and oval leaves with wavy edges"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like smooth elephant skin - silvery gray - and the leaves are shaped like pointy ovals with wavy edges, like the edges of a fancy pie crust"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel thin and smooth, and the bark feels cool and smooth like touching a gray elephant"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a fresh green smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "European Beech trees are so good at making shade that almost nothing grows underneath them! In Europe, these trees can live for hundreds of years and grow so big that 6 kids holding hands couldn't reach around the trunk. The word 'book' comes from an old word for 'beech' because people used to write on thin slices of beech wood before paper was invented!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth and silver-gray like elephant skin, without any cracks or peeling?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, furrowed, or peeling, it's not a beech tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they oval with wavy edges and straight, parallel lines (veins) running from the middle to small teeth?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have a different shape or don't have straight veins running to teeth, it might be another tree with smooth bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the leaves purple or coppery colored, or green with wavy edges between the tiny teeth? (Or if it's fall, are the leaves yellow, orange, or coppery brown?)"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the leaves don't have wavy edges between the teeth, it might be an American Beech rather than a European Beech"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree growing in a park, garden, or landscape setting (not a wild forest in California)?"
        yes_next: "You found a European Beech!"
        no_next: "Beech trees are not native to California, so they're usually only found where people have planted them"
  
  seasonal_timeline:

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Green leaves turn yellow to coppery bronze before falling; purple varieties may show less dramatic change; bristly husks may release triangular nuts"
      reproductive_activity: "Nuts mature and fall from open husks"
      identification_tips: "Coppery fall color; bristly husks with triangular nuts; smooth silver-gray bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the green leaves turn golden and coppery, like toast, and you might find spiky seed cases that look like tiny sea urchins with triangular nuts inside"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Smooth silver-gray bark stands out in winter landscape; slender branches with long, pointed cigar-shaped buds; young trees often retain some dead leaves"

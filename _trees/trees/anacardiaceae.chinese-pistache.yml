tree:
  common_name: "Chinese Pistache"
  scientific_name: "Pistacia chinensis"
  family: "Anacardiaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences)
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with attractive compound leaves that turn brilliant red, orange, and yellow in fall. It has a rounded, umbrella-like canopy and distinctively textured gray-brown bark. Widely planted in California landscapes for its outstanding fall color and heat tolerance."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with 10-16 pointed leaflets arranged along a central stem; spectacular red-orange fall color; round umbrella-like canopy"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown bark with distinctive texture that resembles alligator skin when mature; tiny green flowers in spring; small berry-like fruits on female trees that turn red then blue-purple"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright red-orange-yellow fall foliage; small clusters of fruits on female trees turning from red to blue-purple in late fall; bare winter branches with distinctive silhouette"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike sumac, has rounder leaflets and more tree-like form; unlike ash trees, leaflets have smooth edges without teeth; unlike true pistache (nut tree), produces inedible berry-like fruits"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Compound leaves with multiple pointed leaflets along a central stem; amazing red and orange fall color"
    memorable_comparison: "In fall, the leaves look like they're on fire with bright red and orange flames; the bark on older trees looks like alligator skin"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth and slightly leathery, and the bark feels bumpy like dinosaur skin on older trees"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild, slightly sweet scent"
    fun_fact: "Chinese Pistache trees put on one of the most spectacular fall color shows in California - like fireworks in slow motion! The tree is related to mangoes and cashews, but its tiny fruits are only good for birds to eat, not people."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they compound (divided into smaller leaflets along a central stem)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Chinese Pistache - look for a tree with compound leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaflets. Do they have smooth edges without teeth, and are they pointed at the tips?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be an ash tree or another compound-leaf tree if the leaflets have toothed edges"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the overall tree shape. Does it have a rounded, umbrella-like shape?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Could be another tree with compound leaves - check other features"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In fall, do the leaves turn bright red, orange, and yellow?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "If it's not fall yet, check the bark. On older trees, does it have a distinct pattern that looks like alligator skin?"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "Look at where the tree is growing. Is it planted in a yard, park, or along a street rather than in a wild forest?"
        yes_next: "You found a Chinese Pistache!"
        no_next: "Chinese Pistache trees are almost always planted by people, not found in wild areas"

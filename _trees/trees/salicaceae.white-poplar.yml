  # Basic summary
  summary: "White Poplar is a fast-growing deciduous tree known for its distinctive white to silvery-gray bark and leaves that are dark green on top but bright white and fuzzy underneath. When the wind blows, the leaves flip to reveal their white undersides, creating a striking, flickering effect. It has a broad, irregular crown and produces fluffy catkins in spring."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Leaves with bright white, felt-like undersides; smooth white to silvery-gray bark on upper trunk and branches; leaves often maple-like with 3-5 lobes"
    secondary_markers: "Broad, irregular crown shape; bark on lower trunk becomes deeply furrowed with age; white fuzzy shoots in spring"
    seasonal_markers: "Fluffy catkins appear in early spring before leaves; summer shows striking contrast between dark green upper leaf surface and white undersides; yellowish fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Quaking Aspen, has distinctly lobed leaves (not oval) with white undersides (not just pale green); unlike Silver Maple, has smooth white bark on upper branches; unlike other poplars, has bright white leaf undersides"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with bright white fuzzy undersides that show when the wind blows, and smooth white bark"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like they're wearing white fuzzy mittens underneath, and when the wind blows, it looks like the tree is waving with white mittens!"
    touch_tip: "Feel the underside of a leaf - it's soft and fuzzy like a stuffed animal, while the top is smooth"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the sticky buds in spring have a faint sweet smell"
    fun_fact: "White Poplar trees are like nature's magic show! When the wind blows, the leaves flip to show their bright white undersides, making the whole tree look like it's flickering between green and silver. This is why people sometimes call it the 'silver-leaf poplar' or 'dancing tree'!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's bark. Is the bark on the upper trunk and branches smooth and white or silvery-gray?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a White Poplar - check other trees with silver leaf undersides"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is the top green but the bottom covered with bright white fuzzy material that feels like felt?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a White Poplar - if leaves are silver on both sides, check Russian Olive; if just pale green underneath, check aspens"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaf shape. Does it have lobes (sections) somewhat like a maple leaf rather than being oval or heart-shaped?"
        yes_next: "You found a White Poplar!"
        no_next: "If leaves aren't lobed but have white undersides, check other poplar species"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Red-purple catkins appear before leaves; new leaves unfold with white, fuzzy coating; young shoots covered with white fuzz"
      reproductive_activity: "Male and female catkins open (on separate trees); wind carries pollen to female trees"
      identification_tips: "Catkins and white fuzzy new growth are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for fuzzy 'caterpillar-like' flowers hanging down before the leaves come out, and new twigs covered with white fuzz like cotton candy"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full leaf development; dark green leaf tops contrast with white undersides, creating flickering effect in breeze"
      reproductive_activity: "Female trees develop cotton-like seeds that are released and carried by wind"
      identification_tips: "White leaf undersides are very distinctive and visible when wind blows"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, stand under the tree on a breezy day and watch how the leaves flash white when they flip upside down - it looks like magic!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow before falling; white bark becomes more noticeable as leaves drop"
      reproductive_activity: "No reproductive activity; seed dispersal completed"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and white bark visible as leaves fall"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow like butter before dropping off, making it easier to see the white bark on the branches"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal white to silvery-gray bark; buds form for next spring"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; catkin buds present for next spring"
      identification_tips: "White bark stands out in winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the white bark really stands out against other trees, looking silvery-white like it's covered in frost even when it's not"

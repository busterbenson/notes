tree:
  common_name: "Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir"
  scientific_name: "Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen conifer with flat, soft needles that have a distinctive blue-gray color. Like all Douglas-firs, it has unique hanging cones with three-pointed 'mouse tail' bracts sticking out between the scales, but this mountain variety is more adapted to cold and drought than its coastal relative."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Hanging cones with distinctive 'mouse tail' bracts; blue-gray needles that are flatter than spruce"
    secondary_markers: "Long, pointed, reddish-brown buds at branch tips; deeply furrowed bark on mature trees; grows in eastern California mountains"
    seasonal_markers: "Blue-gray new growth in spring; cones mature in late summer and drop intact in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Douglas-fir, has blue-gray rather than dark green needles and grows in eastern rather than western California mountains; unlike true firs (Abies), has hanging cones rather than upright ones"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue-gray needles and cones with little 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales"
    memorable_comparison: "The cones look like they have tiny mice hiding inside with their tails sticking out, and the needles look like they're covered in blue dust"

    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle to smell a sweet, fresh scent like Christmas trees"
    fun_fact: "Douglas-firs aren't actually true firs at all! Scientists gave them a special name, Pseudotsuga, which means 'false hemlock' because they're so unique."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Are they flat and blue-gray colored?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir - if the needles are dark green, it might be a Coast Douglas-fir instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Find a cone on the ground under the tree. Do you see little three-pronged 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Douglas-fir - check for other conifer types"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are you in a mountain area that gets cold winters and not near the coast?"
        yes_next: "You found a Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir!"
        no_next: "If you're near the coast, it might be a Coast Douglas-fir, which has greener needles"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii)"
      differences: "Coast Douglas-fir has darker green needles without the blue-gray color; generally grows taller and in milder coastal areas"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has green rather than blue-gray needles and you're near the coast, it's likely the coast variety"

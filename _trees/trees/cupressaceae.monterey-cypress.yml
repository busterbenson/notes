  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A uniquely shaped, wind-sculpted evergreen tree native to a tiny area of California's central coast. It has scale-like leaves that form dense sprays, rounded cones, and a distinctive silhouette shaped by coastal winds."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Irregular, flat-topped crown with spreading branches; scale-like leaves forming dense sprays; rounded, woody cones about 1-2 inches in size"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown, furrowed bark that splits into flat ridges; foliage typically gray-green; distinctive wind-swept appearance"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; pollen cones release yellow pollen in late winter/early spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Incense-cedar, has rounded rather than flattened sprays; unlike Italian Cypress, grows wide rather than columnar; unlike Arizona Cypress, has darker green rather than blue-green foliage"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with tiny scale-like leaves that looks like it's been blown sideways by the wind"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a tree that's standing in a very windy place with its arms stretched out and its hair blown to one side"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel like tiny overlapping fish scales arranged in flat sprays"
    smell_tip: "Gently rub the leaves to smell a fresh, lemony-cedar scent (don't break or crush them)"
    fun_fact: "Monterey Cypress trees only grow naturally along a tiny stretch of California's coast, less than 4 miles long! That makes their natural home smaller than most city parks. Outside this tiny area, people have planted them all over the world, from New Zealand to Great Britain, where they grow much bigger than in their windswept home."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall shape. Does the tree have a broad, flat top or look like it's been blown sideways by the wind?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's tall and narrow like a column, it might be Italian Cypress; if it has a normal cone shape, check other cypress species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like fish scales, making flat sprays rather than needles?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a cypress - check if it has needles instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the cones. Are they round, about the size of a ping-pong ball, with bumpy scales?"
        yes_next: "You found a Monterey Cypress!"
        no_next: "It could be another cypress species - check the overall color and shape"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears as slightly brighter green at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Watch for yellowish pollen cones and bright green new growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, tiny yellow pollen cones might cover the tree and make yellow dust when you shake a branch"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Foliage matures to consistent blue-green color; young cones grow larger"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones continue developing, turning from green to brown"
      identification_tips: "Young green cones become visible as they develop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for baby cones that start green and slowly turn woody and brown like tiny round pinecones"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen; mature cones become woody"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature but typically remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Mature cones turn brown and woody, with raised scales"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Unlike many trees, this one stays the exact same color in fall - no reds or yellows, just the same gray-green all year long"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "New pollen cones form for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive silhouette stands out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, small yellowish pollen cones start to form, getting ready to release pollen in early spring"

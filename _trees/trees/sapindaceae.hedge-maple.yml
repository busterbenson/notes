  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous tree with a dense, rounded crown and distinctive small, five-lobed leaves. Native to Europe and western Asia, it is valued for its tolerance of poor soils, pollution, and pruning, making it an excellent choice for hedges, screens, and urban landscapes. Its adaptability, reliable yellow fall color, and compact size make it a versatile landscape tree throughout much of California."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small, five-lobed maple leaves with rounded lobes and smooth margins; leaves grow opposite each other on branches; dense, rounded crown"
    secondary_markers: "Corky ridges often develop on twigs and younger branches; small green-yellow flowers in spring; paired winged seeds (helicopter seeds) with wings spreading horizontally"
    seasonal_markers: "Reliable yellow fall color; small green flowers in spring appear with the leaves; winged seed pairs mature in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike most maples, leaf edges are mostly smooth (not serrated); smaller leaves than many maples; distinctive corky bark on twigs helps distinguish from other small maples"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Small maple leaves with 5 roundish lobes and smooth edges (not jagged or toothed)"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like little maple leaves with rounded mittens instead of pointy fingers"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's smooth on the edges, unlike most maple leaves that have tiny teeth"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but you can feel how they're thicker and tougher than many maple leaves"
    fun_fact: "Hedge Maple is super tough! It can be shaped like a hedge wall (that's how it got its name), and its twigs grow special bumpy cork ridges that feel rough - like they're wearing armor!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the size of the tree - is it medium-sized (about as tall as a two-story house)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's a very tall tree, it might not be a Hedge Maple"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they small maple leaves with 5 roundish lobes that aren't pointy?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Hedge Maple - most other maples have more pointed lobes"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the edges of the leaves. Are they mostly smooth without tiny teeth?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Hedge Maple - most other maples have toothed leaf edges"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at how the leaves grow on the branches. Do they grow in pairs directly across from each other?"
        yes_next: "You found a Hedge Maple!"
        no_next: "Not a Hedge Maple - all maples have opposite leaves"

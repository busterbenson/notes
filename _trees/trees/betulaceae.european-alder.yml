  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous tree with rounded, dark green leaves that have notched tips and wavy, toothed edges. It produces dangling yellow-brown catkins in spring and small woody cone-like fruits that persist on the branches. Usually found near water, with greenish-brown bark that develops rectangular plates as it ages."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Rounded leaves with notched tips; grows near water; small woody cone-like fruits that look like tiny pinecones"
    secondary_markers: "Purple buds in winter; greenish-brown to gray bark that develops rectangular plates with age; sticky young leaves in spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Round leaves with a little notch at the tip that look like someone took a tiny bite from them"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like green pancakes with tiny teeth around the edges and a bite taken out of the top"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel sturdy and a little wavy, and young leaves might feel sticky like they have maple syrup on them"

    fun_fact: "European Alder is a superpower tree! Its roots have special bacteria that can pull nitrogen from the air and turn it into natural plant food in the soil. It's like a natural fertilizer factory! The wood is also special because it doesn't rot underwater - it was used to build the foundations of old buildings in Venice, Italy, and they're still standing after hundreds of years!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where the tree is growing. Is it near water like a stream, pond, or in a wet area?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's in a dry area, it's probably not a European Alder"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they rounded with a small notch at the tip, like someone took a tiny bite out of them?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves don't have a notched tip, it might be a different kind of alder"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for small woody cone-like fruits about the size of a marble. Can you find any on the tree or on the ground underneath?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's early spring, look for hanging catkins instead"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's winter, check for purple buds on the branches. Can you see them?"
        yes_next: "You found a European Alder!"
        no_next: "Check the bark - on mature trees, it should have rectangular plates or scales"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "The tallest type of tree in the world, growing as high as a 35-story building with a narrow, straight shape and reddish-brown spongy bark. Has flat, soft, leaf-like needles growing in a feather pattern and small round cones about the size of a grape."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Extremely tall tree with soft, flat needles in feather-like pattern; thick, spongy reddish-brown bark"
    secondary_markers: "Small round woody cones about the size of a grape; narrow tree top with branches that point upward"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green all year; small cones ripen in fall; new growth in spring is lighter green"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Giant Sequoia, has flat needles (not spiky) and much smaller cones; unlike Dawn Redwood, keeps its needles all year round (doesn't drop them in fall)"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super tall tree with soft, feathery needles and spongy reddish-brown bark"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark feels like a giant sponge, and the tree is so tall it can reach higher than a 30-story building!"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels soft and spongy, like you could squeeze it like a kitchen sponge"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a mild, sweet woodsy scent"
    fun_fact: "Coast Redwoods can live for more than 2,000 years! That's older than almost anything built by humans. They're so good at surviving fires that they often live through forest fires that kill other trees. They can even grow new trunks from their base if the main trunk gets hurt!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall size. Is it an extremely tall tree with reddish-brown bark?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Coast Redwood - try another evergreen tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Touch the bark if you can reach it. Does it feel spongy and soft, with deep grooves?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Coast Redwood - if the bark is flaky or hard, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they flat, soft, and arranged like feathers?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Coast Redwood - if needles grow in bunches or are tiny and overlapping, check other trees"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for cones on the tree or ground. Are they small (about the size of a grape) and woody?"
        yes_next: "You found a Coast Redwood!"
        no_next: "If the cones are bigger than a ping pong ball, it might be a Giant Sequoia or another type of tree"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears at branch tips with lighter green color than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow dust; female cones start forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for the difference between fresh light green growth and older darker needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new growth at the tips of branches - it looks like the tree is growing little green fingers!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth turns darker to match older needles; tree has full set of needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones keep growing, staying green"
      identification_tips: "Dark green color all over; small growing cones if you look closely"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the whole tree looks dark green, and tiny green cones start growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older inside needles might turn yellow and fall; tree stays mostly green"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones turn brown and open to drop seeds"
      identification_tips: "Look for open brown cones and tiny seeds on the ground under the tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the tiny cones open up and drop seeds smaller than a grain of rice!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Needles stay dark green; empty cones might stay on the tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree rests; some cones might keep growing slowly"
      identification_tips: "Reddish bark stands out in winter; stays green when other trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Coast Redwood stays green while other trees lose their leaves"

  confirmation_checklist:
    - feature: "Spongy, reddish-brown bark"
      reliability: "Very high"
      visibility: "High - can see from a fair distance away"
    - feature: "Flat, soft needles in feather-like patterns"
      reliability: "High"
      visibility: "Medium - need to look at branches up close"
    - feature: "Small (grape-sized) round woody cones"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum)"
      differences: "Giant Sequoia has spiky, prickly leaves (not flat needles); much bigger cones (golf ball sized); thicker trunk compared to height; grows in Sierra Nevada mountains, not along coast"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are small and prickly (not flat and soft), and the cones are bigger than a golf ball, it's likely Giant Sequoia"
    
    - species: "Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides)"
      differences: "Dawn Redwood drops all its needles in fall; has needles growing opposite each other (Coast Redwood's alternate); usually not as tall; not native to California"
      identification_tip: "If the tree drops all its needles in fall, it's Dawn Redwood (not Coast Redwood)"
    
    - species: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      differences: "Douglas-fir has special hanging cones with three-pointed 'mouse tails'; needles grow all around the branch rather than in flat rows; bark isn't as spongy or red"
      identification_tip: "If the cones have little 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales, it's Douglas-fir, not Redwood"

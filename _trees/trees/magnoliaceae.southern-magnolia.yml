  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super big, glossy leaves that feel like leather, with rusty-brown fuzzy undersides"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves are bigger than your hand, and the flowers are as big as dinner plates"
    touch_tip: "Feel both sides of a leaf - top side is smooth and waxy, bottom side is fuzzy like a teddy bear"
    smell_tip: "If there's a flower, smell it from a few feet away for a sweet lemony scent (the smell can be very strong up close!)"
    fun_fact: "The Southern Magnolia's flowers are so old-fashioned that they evolved before bees existed! They're pollinated by beetles instead."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look for big, glossy dark green leaves that stay on the tree all year. Are they as big as your hand or bigger?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Southern Magnolia - look for trees with larger leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Turn over a leaf. Is the bottom covered with rusty-brown fuzz?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Southern Magnolia - check for leaves with fuzzy rusty undersides"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the branches. Do the leaves grow in a staggered pattern (not directly across from each other)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Southern Magnolia - try trees with alternate leaf patterns"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In summer, look for huge white flowers that smell sweet and lemony. In fall and winter, look for pine cone-like seed pods with red seeds."
        yes_next: "You found a Southern Magnolia!"
        no_next: "It might be a Southern Magnolia, but come back in summer to check for the big white flowers"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small deciduous tree or large shrub native to the Pacific Northwest, characterized by its vine-like growth pattern in shady conditions and multiple trunks. Distinguished by its rounded leaves with 7-9 pointed lobes arranged in a circular pattern and spectacular fall colors ranging from yellow to deep crimson. While native to northwestern California, it's considered non-native to most of the state where it may be found as an ornamental planting valued for shade tolerance, attractive form, and brilliant autumn display."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Rounded leaves with 7-9 pointed lobes in a circular pattern; opposite leaf arrangement"
    secondary_markers: "Multiple slender trunks; smooth greenish to reddish bark on young stems"
    seasonal_markers: "Brilliant yellow to red fall color; reddish-purple flowers in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Japanese Maple, has less deeply divided leaves; unlike Bigleaf Maple, much smaller size; unlike Douglas and Rocky Mountain Maple, has 7-9 lobes rather than 3-5"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences)
  summary: "A small deciduous tree or large shrub known for its spectacular summer flowers in shades of pink, purple, red, or white. It has distinctive smooth, peeling bark that creates a mottled, multicolored pattern and small, oval leaves that turn orange-red in fall. Widely planted throughout California for its long-lasting summer blooms and drought tolerance."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Showy clusters of crinkled flowers in summer; smooth, peeling bark with mottled pattern; multi-stemmed growth habit"
    secondary_markers: "Small oval leaves arranged opposite each other; seed capsules that persist through winter; orange-red fall color"
    seasonal_markers: "Vibrant flowers in summer; attractive peeling bark visible year-round; seed capsules persist in winter; orange-red fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike eastern redbud, blooms in summer rather than spring; unlike lilac, has peeling bark and summer rather than spring flowers; unlike bottlebrush, has deciduous leaves and different flower structure"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Crinkly paper-like flowers in bright colors growing in big clusters in summer"
    memorable_comparison: "The flowers look like bunches of colorful, crinkled tissue paper, and the smooth peeling bark looks like a puzzle with different colored pieces"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth, and you might see it peeling naturally like puzzle pieces"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light, sweet smell if you sniff them gently"
    fun_fact: "Crape Myrtle trees can bloom for up to 120 days - that's 4 whole months of flowers! Also, the name comes from the crinkly flowers that look like crepe paper."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "In summer, look for a small tree covered with bunches of colorful, crinkly flowers. Do you see a tree with pink, purple, red, or white flower clusters?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's not summer, look for other features. If it is summer and the tree isn't flowering, it's probably not a Crape Myrtle"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it smooth with patches of different colors like tan, gray, and cinnamon-brown, and does it peel naturally?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Check if it might be another flowering tree or shrub"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at how it grows. Does it have several trunks growing from the base rather than one main trunk?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "It might be a Crape Myrtle trained to a single trunk, or it could be another flowering tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they small, oval-shaped, and mostly growing in pairs opposite each other on the branches?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "Might be another flowering tree or shrub"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "Where is it growing? Is it planted in a yard, park, or along a street in a sunny spot?"
        yes_next: "You found a Crape Myrtle!"
        no_next: "Crape Myrtles are almost always planted by people in sunny spots, not found in wild areas or deep shade"

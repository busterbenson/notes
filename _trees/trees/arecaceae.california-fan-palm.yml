  # Basic summary information
  summary: "California's only native palm tree, with a thick trunk and large fan-shaped fronds that spread like an open hand. Wild trees often have a distinctive 'skirt' of dead fronds hanging down the trunk."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Tall palm with large fan-shaped leaves and often a 'skirt' of dead fronds hanging down the trunk"
    secondary_markers: "Thick trunk, gray-green fan-shaped fronds, thin filaments hanging from leaf edges"
    seasonal_markers: "Black berries in large clusters hanging beneath the fronds in late summer and fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Mexican Fan Palm, has a thicker trunk and shorter overall height; Mexican Fan Palm is thinner and taller"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tall palm tree with big fan-shaped leaves that spread out like an open hand"
    memorable_comparison: "Wild ones look like they're wearing a grass skirt made of dead brown leaves hanging down the trunk"
    touch_tip: "The leaves have thin strings hanging from the edges like loose threads on a piece of cloth"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell in spring, and the fruit has a date-like smell when ripe"
    fun_fact: "This is the only palm tree that's originally from California! Native Americans used almost every part of this tree - eating the fruits, weaving the leaves into baskets, and using the fibers for sandals and rope. In the wild, these palms show where water is hiding underground in the desert!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, is it a palm tree with big leaves shaped like fans or hands?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a California Fan Palm - palm trees have one thick trunk and big fan or feather leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the trunk. Is it thick (like a trash can) with maybe a 'skirt' of dead brown leaves hanging down?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a Mexican Fan Palm - they're skinnier and taller"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaf edges. Do they have stringy fibers hanging from them like loose threads?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Fan Palm!"
        no_next: "Might be another type of palm - California Fan Palms have stringy threads on their leaf edges"

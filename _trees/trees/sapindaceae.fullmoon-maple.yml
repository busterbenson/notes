  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous maple native to Japan with distinctive rounded, deeply-lobed leaves that resemble a full moon in outline. Known for spectacular fall colors ranging from golden yellow to crimson, delicate spring flowers, and an elegant, layered growth habit. Prized in Japanese gardens for centuries and now valued in ornamental landscapes worldwide."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Rounded leaves with 9-11 deep lobes radiating from a central point; leaves grow opposite each other on branches; brilliant fall colors ranging from yellow to red and purple"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Round leaves that look like little full moons with deep cuts, like moon craters"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like paper cutout decorations with deep cuts around the edges"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's soft and slightly fuzzy, especially on the underside"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently - it has a mild, pleasant green scent"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called a Fullmoon Maple because when you hold up a leaf, it looks like a full moon with deep cuts (like moon craters) radiating from the center. In fall, these moon-shaped leaves turn brilliant colors like red, orange, and purple!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if it's a small tree with branches that spread out in layers"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a Fullmoon Maple - they're usually small trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they round like a circle with deep cuts that go almost to the center?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Fullmoon Maple - check trees with star-shaped leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow on the branch. Do they grow directly opposite each other, not in a zigzag pattern?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Fullmoon Maple - they have opposite leaves"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Count the lobes (points) on the leaf. Does it have 9-11 lobes arranged in a circle?"
        yes_next: "You found a Fullmoon Maple!"
        no_next: "Might be a different type of maple - Fullmoon Maples have more lobes than most other maples"

  summary: Striped Maple is a small deciduous understory tree recognized by its distinctive green bark with white vertical stripes. Native to eastern North America but not California, it features three-lobed leaves with finely serrated edges arranged in opposite pairs. The tree produces hanging clusters of yellow-green flowers in spring and paired winged seeds (samaras) typical of maples. Its attractive bark, shade tolerance, and vibrant yellow fall color make it an occasional ornamental specimen in California gardens with adequate moisture and shade.

    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it green with white stripes going up and down?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Striped Maple. No other tree has green bark with white stripes like this!"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the leaves grow on the branches. Do they grow in pairs, directly across from each other?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Striped Maple. Check trees with alternate leaf arrangements instead."
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Count the lobes on each leaf. Does each leaf have exactly three pointed lobes?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Probably not Striped Maple. If it has more lobes, check other maple species."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is it a small tree, growing in a shady spot, maybe under bigger trees?"
        yes_next: "You found a Striped Maple! In California, these are rare finds mostly in special gardens."
        no_next: "It could still be a Striped Maple, but these trees usually prefer shade and don't get very tall."

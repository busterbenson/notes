  # Basic summary information
  summary: "One of the world's oldest living organisms, the Bristlecone Pine is a gnarled, twisted evergreen tree that thrives in harsh high-elevation environments. Known for its extreme longevity (some trees over 4,000 years old), weathered appearance, and bristle-tipped cone scales."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Twisted, gnarled growth form with exposed dead wood; needles in bundles of five; found in harsh high-elevation environments"
    secondary_markers: "Short needles that persist for 20-40 years; small cones with bristle-like prickles; reddish-brown bark on younger branches contrasting with weathered gray wood"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays evergreen year-round; cones mature in fall of second year"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Whitebark Pine, has bristles on cone scales; unlike Limber Pine, has smaller cones and shorter needles; unlike most pines, frequently shows extensive dead wood that remains attached for centuries"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A twisted, gnarled pine tree that can live for thousands of years, with bundles of five short needles"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a tree shaped by a powerful wizard - all twisted and ancient, with parts that look dead but are still alive, like a tree that's survived thousands of years of magic storms!"
    touch_tip: "The needles come in bundles of five and feel stiff but not sharp. They're shorter than other pine needles."
    smell_tip: "If you gently crush a few needles, they have a mild pine scent that's less strong than most pines."
    fun_fact: "Bristlecone Pines are the oldest living things on Earth! Some are over 4,000 years old - that means they were already ancient trees when the pyramids in Egypt were being built!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where the tree is growing. Is it in a harsh, rocky area at very high elevation (above 9,000 feet) in eastern California mountains?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Bristlecone Pine - they only grow in very high, harsh environments"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape. Is it twisted and gnarled with sections that look dead but are still attached to the tree?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another high-mountain pine like Whitebark Pine or Limber Pine"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the needles. Do they come in bundles of exactly 5 needles, and are they short (about as long as your thumb)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Bristlecone Pine - check other high-elevation pines"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small cones with tiny bristles on the scales (you might need a cone that's fallen to the ground to see this)."
        yes_next: "You found a Bristlecone Pine, one of the oldest living things on Earth!"
        no_next: "If the cones don't have bristles, it might be a Whitebark Pine or Limber Pine instead"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Little visual change; new growth appears as slightly lighter green needle tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones may form on branch tips; pollination occurs"
      identification_tips: "May be inaccessible due to snow at high elevations; little seasonal change to observe"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for tiny new light green needle tips, like the tree is getting new hair!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures; purple immature seed cones may be visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones continue developing after spring pollination"
      identification_tips: "Best season for access due to snow melt; twisted form most visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is the best time to visit these ancient trees, when the snow has melted and you can see their twisted, magical shapes"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little color change as it's evergreen; cones mature to brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones mature in their second year; may release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Accessibility decreasing with early mountain snows; look for mature cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for small brown pinecones that have tiny bristles on each scale"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes except snow accumulation"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Usually inaccessible due to deep snow; no seasonal identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, these trees are usually buried in deep snow at the top of mountains, resting until spring"

  # Look-alike species
  look_alikes:
    - species: "Whitebark Pine (Pinus albicaulis)"
      differences: "Whitebark Pine has similar size and also grows at high elevations, but has a more upright growth habit, lacks the distinctive twisted form, and its cones lack bristles"
      identification_tip: "Bristlecone has more twisted growth, exposed dead wood, and bristles on cone scales"
    - species: "Limber Pine (Pinus flexilis)"
      differences: "Limber Pine also grows at high elevations but has longer needles (2-3 inches), larger cones (3-8 inches), and rarely shows the extreme twisted growth form"
      identification_tip: "Bristlecone has shorter needles, smaller cones, and more twisted, ancient appearance"
    - species: "Foxtail Pine (Pinus balfouriana)"
      differences: "Foxtail Pine is another ancient high-elevation pine, but has needles densely packed along branches like a fox's tail, and grows in different California mountain ranges"

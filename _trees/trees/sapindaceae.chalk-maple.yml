  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Looks like a miniature maple tree with bright white bark like it's been painted with chalk"
    memorable_comparison: "It's like a maple tree that decided to stay kid-sized instead of growing up, with bark that looks like it's been dusted with white chalk"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth the chalky bark is, and notice how the leaves grow directly across from each other"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but in fall they smell a bit like most fallen leaves"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called Chalk Maple because its bark looks like it's been rubbed with white chalk! In fall, its leaves turn amazingly bright red and orange colors - like they're on fire!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the size of the tree. Is it small (about as tall as a one-story house)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's much taller than a house, it's probably a different kind of maple"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it chalky white or very light gray, almost like it's been painted white?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the bark is dark or brown, it's probably a different maple species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow. Do they grow in pairs, directly opposite each other on the branches?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If leaves alternate along the branch, it's not a maple tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Are they star-shaped with 3-5 shallow points (lobes)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Chalk Maple!"
        no_next: "It might be another maple species - check how deep the points (lobes) on the leaves are"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge light green; small yellow-green flowers appear on bare branches or with emerging leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by wind and insects"

      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full dark green color; winged seed pairs develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Winged seeds (helicopter seeds) form and begin to mature"
      identification_tips: "Small size, chalky bark, and smaller leaves than other maples are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you'll see the paired helicopter seeds growing - they're smaller than other maple seeds"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn spectacular orange-red to burgundy; winged seeds mature and fall"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and are dispersed by wind"
      identification_tips: "Brilliant fall color and chalky bark stand out"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, this tree puts on an amazing color show with bright red-orange leaves!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Loses all leaves, revealing branch structure and white bark"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds form for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Chalky white bark is most noticeable in winter; look for opposite branching pattern"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can really see how white the bark is - like the tree got dusted with chalk or snow"

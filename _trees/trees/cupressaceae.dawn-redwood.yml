  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous conifer with feathery, bright green needles arranged in opposite pairs along the twigs. It has a distinctive conical shape with a buttressed trunk base, and turns rusty orange-brown in fall before dropping its needles."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A conifer (like a Christmas tree) that surprisingly drops all its needles in fall after turning orange-brown"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a Christmas tree in summer but then gets fall colors and goes bare in winter - it's like a tree that can't decide if it's an evergreen or not!"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and feathery - gently run your fingers along a branch to feel them"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a fresh, slightly sweet scent"
    fun_fact: "Dawn Redwoods are living fossils! Scientists thought they were extinct and only found as fossils until 1944 when living trees were discovered in China. It's like finding a real dinosaur alive today!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Is it shaped like a Christmas tree (cone or pyramid shape)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it has a different shape, it's probably not a Dawn Redwood"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the small branches and needles grow. Do they grow in pairs exactly opposite each other (like when you hold your arms straight out to your sides)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the branches and needles grow in an alternating pattern, check for Bald Cypress instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the needles turning rusty orange-brown? Or if it's winter, did it drop all its needles?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it stays green all winter with needles, it's probably a different conifer like pine or spruce"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the base of the trunk. Does it flare out widely at the bottom, almost like tree legs or buttresses?"
        yes_next: "You found a Dawn Redwood!"
        no_next: "It might be a Larch or Bald Cypress - check the branch pattern and trunk shape again"

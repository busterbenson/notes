  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall, majestic evergreen tree with a straight trunk, symmetrical pyramid shape, and bluish-green needles that curve upward. It has distinctive upright cones that sit on branches like candles and smooth gray bark with resin blisters."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bluish-green needles that curve upward and appear to grow from the sides of branches; upright cylindrical cones; symmetric pyramid shape"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark on younger trees; flat needles with rounded tips; needles often appear frosted"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright blue-green new growth in spring; upright purple-green cones in summer turning brown in fall"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A Christmas tree shape with bluish-green needles that curve upward and cones that stand up on the branches like candles"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like they're doing a wave, curving up from the branch like they're cheering"
    touch_tip: "Feel the needles - they're flat and bendy, not sharp, and have white stripes on the bottom"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently and smell the sweet pine scent"
    fun_fact: "Noble Firs are one of the most popular Christmas trees because their strong branches can hold heavy ornaments without drooping! They're also one of the tallest trees in the Northwest and can grow as tall as a 25-story building!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree shape. Is it perfectly triangle-shaped (like a Christmas tree) with branches in neat layers?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a Noble Fir - check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Do they curve upward like they're smiling, and do they mostly grow from the sides of the branch (not all around)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Noble Fir - check firs with different needle arrangements"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it has cones, do they stand upright on the branches like candles on a cake (not hanging down)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Noble Fir! Notice the blue-green color of the needles that makes this tree special."
        no_next: "If the cones hang down, it's probably a different evergreen tree like a hemlock or spruce."
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright blue-green new growth emerges at branch tips; male pollen cones release yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "New growth is lighter blue-green and softer than older needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green new needles at the tips of branches that are softer than the older needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth hardens off; upright female cones grow and turn from purple-green to light brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones grow to full size but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Upright, green-purple cones are very distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see green-purple cones standing up on branches like birthday candles"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No needle color change; cones mature and turn brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature; scales begin to break apart to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Brown upright cones; consistent blue-green color while deciduous trees change"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown while the needles stay blue-green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; most cone scales have fallen, leaving spikes on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive blue-green color stands out in winter; perfect pyramid shape often bears snow well"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the blue-green color looks bright against the snow, and you might see the cone spikes left on branches after seeds are released"

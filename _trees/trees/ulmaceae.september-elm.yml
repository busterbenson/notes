tree:
  common_name: "September Elm"
  scientific_name: "Ulmus serotina"
  family: "Ulmaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A vase-shaped deciduous tree with arching branches like a fountain. Gets its unusual name because it flowers in late summer to early fall (September), when most other elms finished flowering back in spring."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Vase-shaped form with arching branches; flowers in fall rather than spring"
    secondary_markers: "Oval leaves with doubly serrated edges and asymmetrical bases; gray-brown bark with diamond-pattern furrows"
    seasonal_markers: "Small reddish-brown flowers in September; yellow fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American Elm, flowers in fall not spring; unlike Chinese Elm, lacks mottled, colorful bark"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Does it look like an umbrella or fountain with branches that spread out and up?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a September Elm - might be a different kind of tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it oval-shaped with two sets of tiny teeth on the edges, and is one side of the leaf base lower than the other (lopsided)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a September Elm - might be another type of tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's fall (September or October), can you see any small flower clusters on the branches? Or small flat winged seeds?"
        yes_next: "You found a September Elm!"
        no_next: "Might still be a September Elm, but check with an adult - it's hard to identify without the fall flowers"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge light green and soft, later than most other elms"
      reproductive_activity: "Unlike other elms, does not flower or produce seeds in spring"
      identification_tips: "The absence of spring flowers helps differentiate it from American Elm"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, this tree is just growing its leaves when other elms are already making flowers"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves mature to dark green forming a dense shade canopy"
      reproductive_activity: "By late summer (August), small flower buds begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for developing flower buds along branches in late summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In late summer, look for tiny flower buds starting to form along the branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow before dropping; small reddish-brown flowers appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers in September-October; small winged seeds develop and disperse"
      identification_tips: "Fall flowering is the key feature for positive identification"
      kid_friendly_tip: "This is when it's easiest to identify! Look for tiny reddish-brown flowers in September, and later small flat seeds with wings"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal vase-shaped silhouette; diamond-patterned bark visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Vase shape and bark pattern help with winter identification"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter without leaves, you can see the tree's fountain-like shape better"

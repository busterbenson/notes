  summary: Trident Maple is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree known for its distinctive three-lobed leaves resembling a trident or pitchfork. Native to eastern Asia, it develops attractive exfoliating bark with age, revealing orange-brown inner layers. While not native to California, it's valued in landscapes for its moderate size, excellent fall color ranging from yellow to red, tolerance of urban conditions, and year-round ornamental qualities. Popular as both a street tree and specimen planting, it's also prized in bonsai cultivation for its small leaves, interesting bark texture, and responsive nature to pruning techniques.

  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with three points that look like tiny pitchforks or the letter 'W' with a stem"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's wearing thousands of tiny wizard tridents for leaves!"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth with just a few tiny teeth on the edges, and older trees have bark that peels like paper"
    smell_tip: "If you gently crush a leaf, it might have a light, sweet maple smell (but it's not very strong)"
    fun_fact: "This tree is a superhero of the plant world - it can grow in tough city conditions where other trees would get sick, and it's also a favorite for making bonsai (tiny trees in pots) because its leaves stay small and neat!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if the leaves grow in pairs directly across from each other on the branch (opposite arrangement)"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Trident Maple - check trees with alternating leaves"
      
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Does each leaf have exactly three pointed tips like a pitchfork or the letter 'W'?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Trident Maple - check Japanese Maple if leaves have more than three points"
      
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree small to medium sized with a neat, rounded shape (not very tall or skinny)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another maple species that grows larger"
      
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the leaves turning yellow-orange to red? If it's an older tree, does the bark peel in thin flakes showing orange-brown underneath?"
        yes_next: "You found a Trident Maple!"
        no_next: "Might still be a Trident Maple if it's young or not fall season yet"

  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge with a reddish tint before turning green"
      reproductive_activity: "Small clusters of reddish flowers appear, usually after leaves emerge"
      identification_tips: "Young leaves are smaller but already show the distinctive three-lobed pattern"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, tiny new leaves appear with a reddish color, along with small bunches of reddish flowers"
    
    - season: "Summer"
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach their full dark green color; tree forms a dense, rounded canopy"
      reproductive_activity: "Paired winged seeds (samaras) begin developing"
      identification_tips: "Fully developed three-lobed leaves with minimal serration are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "During summer, the tree is covered with dark green three-pointed leaves that provide nice shade"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves transform to yellow-orange or bright red; dense canopy becomes a colorful display"
      reproductive_activity: "Winged seed pairs mature and begin to drop, spinning as they fall"
      identification_tips: "Fall color combined with the three-lobed leaf shape is very distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when this tree puts on its best show - the leaves turn bright orange or red, and helicopter seeds spin down"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "After leaf drop, the branching structure is visible; exfoliating bark most noticeable"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Opposite branching pattern and exfoliating bark on mature specimens help winter identification"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can see the neat branches growing in pairs, and on older trees, the cool peeling bark is easier to spot"

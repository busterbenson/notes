tree:
  common_name: Serbian Spruce
  scientific_name: Picea omorika
  family: Pinaceae
  native: false

  summary: Serbian Spruce is an elegant, slender evergreen conifer with a distinctive narrow, spire-like silhouette and remarkable two-toned needles that are dark green above and silvery-white below. Native to a small region between Bosnia and Serbia, this endangered species in its homeland is valued in California landscapes for its graceful form, drooping branchlets, and adaptability to various growing conditions. Its striking columnar shape and bicolor needles make it one of the most easily identifiable spruce species.

  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Distinctive two-tone needles (dark green above, silvery-white below); narrow, spire-like or rocket shape"
    secondary_markers: "Gracefully drooping branchlets; flat needles that are square in cross-section"
    seasonal_markers: "Consistent foliage color year-round; small purplish cones in summer turning brown in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Norway Spruce, has a narrower shape and two-tone needles; unlike Colorado Blue Spruce, has drooping twigs and green/silver (not uniformly blue) needles"

  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Two-tone needles - dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, like tiny green coats with silver linings"
    memorable_comparison: "Shaped like a rocket ship ready for takeoff - tall and super skinny!"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel softer and less pokey than other spruce trees, and the branches are slightly droopy like they're taking a bow"
    smell_tip: "When you gently rub the needles, they have a fresh, light pine scent - not as strong as other spruces"
    fun_fact: "This tree's natural home is smaller than many state parks! It comes from a tiny area between Bosnia and Serbia where it survived the Ice Age hiding in special mountain valleys when many other trees disappeared!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if the tree is shaped like a tall rocket ship or church spire - very tall and skinny"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Serbian Spruce - check Norway Spruce if it's more Christmas tree shaped"
      
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles from different angles. Do they look dark green from above but flash silvery-white when you look up at them from below?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Serbian Spruce - check Colorado Blue Spruce if needles are blue all over"
      
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the branches and twigs. Do the smaller branches droop down gracefully like they're tired or bowing?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another spruce species with more horizontal branches"
      
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In summer or fall, do you see small cones (about the size of your thumb) hanging from branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Serbian Spruce!"
        no_next: "Might still be Serbian Spruce if it's not old enough to make cones yet"

  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New, bright green growth appears at branch tips, contrasting with older, darker needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small male pollen cones release yellow pollen; purple-brown female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "The narrow, spire-like shape and two-tone needles remain distinctive year-round"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for fresh light green tips on branches, like the tree is growing tiny green fingers"
    
    - season: "Summer"
      visual_changes: "New growth matures and darkens; contrast between dark upper surfaces and silvery undersides is most pronounced"
      reproductive_activity: "Young purple-brown female cones continue developing on upper branches"
      identification_tips: "The two-tone needles are most visible when summer breezes flip them around"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you can see the cones growing - they look like little purple pinecones hanging from branches!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Needles maintain their dark green and silver coloration; cones turn light brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and open to release winged seeds"
      identification_tips: "The contrast with colorful deciduous trees makes this evergreen easy to spot"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees change colors in fall, this tree stays green and silver, and its little cones open up to let seeds fly away"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Retains dark green and silver needles; narrow form may catch snow beautifully"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; empty cones may remain on tree"
      identification_tips: "The distinctive narrow silhouette and evergreen foliage stand out in winter landscapes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, this tree looks extra special when snow sits on its branches - like a skinny green rocket wearing a white snow coat!"

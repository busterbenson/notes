  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small deciduous tree with dark purple-red leaves, light pink to white spring flowers, and small round purple fruits. Popular in gardens and street plantings for its colorful leaves that add contrast to landscapes throughout the growing season."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark purple-red leaves throughout the growing season; many small pink flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth dark bark with horizontal lines; small round purple fruits like tiny plums in summer; rounded crown shape"
    seasonal_markers: "Pink flowers in early spring before leaves appear; purple-red leaves in summer; fruits in late summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike flowering cherry trees, keeps its purple-red leaf color all summer; unlike crabapples, has smooth (not rough) bark and purple (not green) leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Purple leaves (like permanent fall colors) and lots of pink flowers in early spring"
    memorable_comparison: "It's like a tree wearing a purple costume all summer long when other trees wear green"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's smooth and a bit leathery, and check the edge which has tiny teeth like a tiny saw"
    smell_tip: "In spring, smell the flowers for a sweet, light perfume (but not too close if you have allergies)"
    fun_fact: "These trees are cousins of cherry trees, peach trees, and almond trees - they're all in the same plant family!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf color. Are the leaves dark purple-red instead of green?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Purple Leaf Plum - look for trees with purple leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the size of the tree. Is it small, about as tall as a two-story house or less?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a different purple-leafed tree - Purple Leaf Plums are relatively small"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth with horizontal lines that look like dashes?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might not be a Purple Leaf Plum - check the bark pattern"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In spring, look for pink or white flowers. In summer, look for small round purple fruits the size of large cherries."
        yes_next: "You found a Purple Leaf Plum!"
        no_next: "It might be a Purple Leaf Plum, but come back in spring to check for the flowers"

      differences: "May have green rather than purple leaves; flower color and fruit size can vary"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are green instead of purple, it's probably a different flowering plum variety"
    - species: "Flowering Cherry (Prunus serrulata)"
      differences: "Has green leaves, not purple; typically has more showy flowers; doesn't usually produce edible fruits"
      identification_tip: "If it has green leaves and very showy flowers but no fruits, it's probably a flowering cherry"
    - species: "Crabapple (Malus species)"
      differences: "Has green leaves; produces apple-like fruits; bark is typically rougher"

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves may turn slightly more reddish before falling; fruit may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruit may remain on tree or drop"
      identification_tips: "Purple leaf color persists until leaf drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the purple leaves might turn a bit more red before they fall off the tree"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; smooth bark more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, developing flower buds"
      identification_tips: "Smooth bark with horizontal lines is most visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, all the leaves fall off and you can see the smooth bark with lines that look like dashes"

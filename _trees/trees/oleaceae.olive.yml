  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized evergreen tree with narrow, silvery-gray leaves and a gnarly, twisted trunk that becomes more sculptural with age. It produces small white flowers and green fruits that ripen to black or purple. Olive trees are extremely long-lived and drought-tolerant, originally from the Mediterranean region."

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Silvery-gray leaves that flash silver in the breeze, with a twisted, gnarly trunk that looks old and wise"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a tree wearing silver jewelry, with a trunk that twists and turns like it's dancing in slow motion"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel leathery on top but soft and fuzzy underneath, like stroking a cat's ear"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a faint, pleasant herbal scent (but be gentle - don't damage the tree!)"
    fun_fact: "Some olive trees are over 2,000 years old! That means they were alive when the Romans were building the Colosseum and Jesus was walking around. The olives you eat at pizza parties come from trees just like this one!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they narrow, with dark green tops and silvery-gray undersides?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an olive tree - try looking at trees with different leaf colors"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow on the branches. Do they grow in pairs facing each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not an olive tree - try trees with opposite leaf arrangements"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the trunk, especially on older trees. Is it twisted and gnarly with deep furrows in the bark?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's a young tree, the trunk might not be twisted yet. Look for olive fruits or the overall silvery appearance."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Depending on the season, do you see small white flowers (spring) or small green to black fruits (fall)?"
        yes_next: "You found an olive tree!"
        no_next: "It still might be an olive tree, especially if it's not flowering or fruiting season, or if it's a fruitless variety"

tree:
  common_name: "Red Gum Eucalyptus"
  scientific_name: "Eucalyptus camaldulensis"
  family: "Myrtaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium to tall evergreen tree with smooth, mottled bark that sheds in patches to reveal a striking mix of white, gray, and reddish colors. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that hang vertically, small white flowers, and distinctive small rounded seed capsules."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Smooth, patchy bark with combinations of cream, gray, and reddish colors; strong eucalyptus smell from crushed leaves"
    secondary_markers: "Lance-shaped leaves that hang vertically; small rounded seed capsules; spreading, somewhat irregular crown"
    seasonal_markers: "White, fuzzy flowers in summer; seed capsules visible year-round; bark most colorful in summer after shedding"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Blue Gum Eucalyptus, has smoother bark with more red tones and smaller seed capsules; unlike Silver Dollar Gum, has longer leaves without the rounded, coin-like shape"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth bark with patches of red, white, and gray colors"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like a patchwork quilt with different colors - reds, whites, and grays"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth the bark is where it has recently peeled"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf and smell the strong eucalyptus scent - like something you might smell when you're sick"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called 'Red Gum' because it often produces a red, sticky sap from wounds in the bark. In Australia, these trees grow along rivers and can live for over 500 years!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's bark. Does it have smooth patches in different colors - white, gray, and reddish?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Red Gum Eucalyptus - check other trees with different bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they long, narrow, and hanging down vertically on the branches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are round or not hanging vertically, check other eucalyptus types"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a strong medicinal smell like cough drops?"
        yes_next: "You found a Red Gum Eucalyptus!"
        no_next: "If there's no strong smell, it might be a different type of tree"

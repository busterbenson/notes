  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Spiky, tough leaves that stay green all year"
    memorable_comparison: "Leaves look like holly leaves with tiny sharp points along the edges, like nature's own stars"
    touch_tip: "Feel how thick and stiff the leaves are - they're tough like leather and built to survive long dry summers"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild earthy scent that reminds you of the forest floor"
    fun_fact: "Some Coast Live Oaks are more than 250 years old - they were already growing when your great-great-great-grandparents were born! In fall, the acorns dropping sound like rain pattering on the ground, and squirrels, deer, and birds throw their own acorn feast party underneath."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they stiff and have spiky edges like a holly leaf?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Coast Live Oak - try looking for other oak trees with different leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Does the tree keep its green leaves all year, even in winter?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Coast Live Oak - check out other oak trees that drop their leaves in fall"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the trunk and branches. Are they often twisty with dark, deeply cracked bark?"
        yes_next: "You found a Coast Live Oak!"
        no_next: "Might be another type of evergreen oak - check if the leaf undersides feel smooth"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaf growth emerges, slightly lighter in color; male pollen structures appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny female flowers form; wind spreads pollen from hanging structures"
      identification_tips: "Look for hanging yellow-green pollen structures and fresh leaf growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tree makes skinny yellow-green dangly strings (called catkins) that release dusty yellow powder into the air to help make baby oak trees"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full dark green color; small acorns developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Young acorns growing but still green"
      identification_tips: "Dark green mature leaves; developing acorns becoming visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for baby acorns starting to grow - they're still green and small in summer"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Acorns turn brown and ripen; some older leaves may drop but tree remains green"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns ripen and drop from tree"
      identification_tips: "Look for fallen acorns beneath the tree; some leaf drop but still mostly green"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is acorn season! Look for acorns on the ground - squirrels and birds love to eat them"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree stays green; may lose some leaves during rainy season"
      reproductive_activity: "Resting; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Green crown stands out when other trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees lose their leaves, Coast Live Oak keeps its green leaves all winter"

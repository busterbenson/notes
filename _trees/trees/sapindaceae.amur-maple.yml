  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small, multi-stemmed deciduous tree or large shrub with a rounded crown and three-lobed leaves. It is especially valued for its brilliant scarlet to burgundy fall color and is often used as an ornamental in smaller landscapes."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small three-lobed maple leaves with elongated middle lobe and finely serrated edges; leaves grow opposite each other on the branches"
    secondary_markers: "Small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers in clusters in late spring; paired winged seeds with wings spreading nearly 180 degrees"
    seasonal_markers: "Brilliant scarlet to burgundy fall color; reddish samaras in summer; fragrant flowers in late spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Small maple leaves with three pointed lobes (the middle one is longer) that grow in pairs"
    memorable_comparison: "Leaves look like tiny maple leaves with three fingers, with the middle finger stretching out longer"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth the leaves are on top and slightly fuzzy underneath when young"
    smell_tip: "In late spring, smell the sweet fragrance of the small white flowers"
    fun_fact: "In fall, Amur Maple leaves turn bright fire-engine red - some of the reddest fall color of any tree! Its helicopter seeds spread out almost in a straight line, unlike most maples where the seeds form a V-shape."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the size of the tree. Is it small (about the size of a large shrub or small tree, not taller than a two-story house)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's a larger tree, it's probably not an Amur Maple"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they small maple leaves with three pointy lobes, with the middle lobe longer than the side lobes?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have 5 or more lobes or all the lobes are the same size, it's probably a different maple"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at how the leaves grow. Do they grow in pairs, directly across from each other on the branches?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the leaves alternate along the branch, it's not a maple"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the leaves turning bright scarlet red? If it's summer, do you see paired helicopter seeds that spread out almost in a straight line?"
        yes_next: "You found an Amur Maple!"
        no_next: "It might still be an Amur Maple, but you should check with an adult to be sure"

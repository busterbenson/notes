  # Basic summary
  summary: "An evergreen conifer with stiff, sharp-pointed needles that smell strong when crushed. It produces unique olive-shaped seeds covered by a fleshy purple coating when ripe. The tree grows with a narrow, pyramid shape when young but becomes more irregular with age."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Stiff, shiny dark green needles about 1-2 inches long with very sharp points; strong, distinctive smell when needles are crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Olive-shaped seeds with fleshy purple covering when ripe; needles arranged in two flat rows along branches; grows in shady, moist canyons"
    seasonal_markers: "No seasonal leaf change; seeds mature and turn purple in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Pacific Yew, has much sharper needle points and larger olive-like seeds instead of red berry-like structures; unlike young Coast Redwood, has stiffer, sharper needles arranged in flat rows"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Very sharp, pointy needles that can poke through clothing, arranged in flat rows along the branches"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like tiny swords arranged like the teeth of a comb, and they're so sharp they can poke through your shirt if you're not careful!"
    touch_tip: "Be very careful - don't grab branches with bare hands because the needles are extremely sharp. Instead, gently touch just one needle on its side with a single finger."
    smell_tip: "With an adult's help, crush just one needle and sniff carefully - it smells like a mix of tomatoes and citrus, very different from other evergreen trees"
    fun_fact: "This tree is a living fossil! Trees very similar to the California Torreya were growing when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Also, its wood is so hard and dense that it doesn't float in water like most woods - it sinks!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the needles are arranged - are they in flat rows along the sides of the branch like a comb?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a California Torreya - check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "CAREFULLY touch the needle tip with one finger - is it extremely sharp and pointy? (Be very careful!)"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Torreya - if needles are soft-tipped, check Pacific Yew instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "With an adult's help, gently crush one needle and smell it - does it have a strong, unusual smell unlike regular pine trees?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Torreya!"
        no_next: "Might be another conifer with sharp needles - check with an adult"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears as lighter green needle tips; small pollen structures may be visible on male trees"
      reproductive_activity: "Male trees release pollen; female trees develop small seed structures"
      identification_tips: "Look for contrasting new growth at branch tips and small pollen structures on male trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the bright green new growth at the tips of branches - they're like tiny green candles on the ends!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Uniform dark green throughout; developing seeds growing larger"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed structures continue developing, growing larger"
      identification_tips: "Shiny dark green needles are distinctive; developing seeds may be visible on female trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the tree looks dark green and shiny, and you might see green olive-shaped seeds starting to grow"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change; seeds mature and develop purple fleshy covering"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and may drop to ground"
      identification_tips: "Look for purple olive-like seeds; tree remains evergreen with no color change"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for seeds that look like small purple olives - but don't eat them! They're for animals and new trees."
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains dark green; no seasonal changes visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Dark green needles and overall shape stand out against deciduous trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter when other trees lose their leaves, the California Torreya stays green with all its sharp needles"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia)"
      differences: "Pacific Yew has softer, less pointy needles and produces bright red berry-like structures instead of olive-like seeds"
      identification_tip: "If the needles don't hurt when you touch them, and the fruit is red, it's likely Pacific Yew, not Torreya"
    - species: "Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) saplings"
      differences: "Young redwoods have softer needles arranged all around the twig, not in flat rows, and have red-brown spongy bark"
      identification_tip: "Redwood needles are softer and arranged differently; bark is redder and spongier"
    - species: "Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)"
      differences: "Hemlock has tiny, soft needles with rounded tips and a drooping top branch"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has a droopy top and small soft needles, it's Hemlock, not Torreya"

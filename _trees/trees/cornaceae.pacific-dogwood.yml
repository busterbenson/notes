  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous tree with large, showy white flower-like bracts, bright red fruit clusters, and distinctive parallel-veined leaves. It grows in forests as an understory tree and has smooth gray bark."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Large white 'flowers' (actually bracts) that appear in spring and sometimes again in fall; oval leaves with strongly parallel veins; bright red berry clusters"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark; opposite leaf arrangement; tiered branching pattern; red to purple fall color"
    seasonal_markers: "Showy white bracts in spring; bright red berries in fall; red-purple fall foliage"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Eastern Flowering Dogwood, has 4-7 bracts (not 4) and grows taller; unlike Kousa Dogwood, has bracts that appear with or before leaves, not after"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with big white 'flowers' (actually special leaves called bracts) that look like stars, and bright red berries in clusters"
    memorable_comparison: "The white bracts look like a star or flower cutout made of paper - they're flat and have perfect pointed tips"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they have lines (veins) that run parallel like train tracks from the base to the tip"
    smell_tip: "The flowers don't have a strong smell, but the leaves sometimes have a slightly sweet scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Pacific Dogwood flowers aren't really flowers! The big white parts that look like petals are actually modified leaves called bracts. The real flowers are the tiny yellow parts in the middle. It's like wearing a fancy costume to look bigger and more noticeable to pollinators!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look for a small tree growing under bigger trees in the forest. Does it have a layer-cake pattern of horizontal branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a Pacific Dogwood - look for trees with more horizontal branching"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they grow exactly opposite each other and have strong parallel veins that curve like train tracks from the base to the tip?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Pacific Dogwood - check other forest trees with different leaf patterns"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In spring or sometimes fall, does it have large white star-shaped 'flowers' with 4-7 pointed bracts, or in late summer/fall does it have bright red berry clusters?"
        yes_next: "You found a Pacific Dogwood! If the white parts are 4-6 inches across and look like a star, you're definitely right."
        no_next: "If it's not flowering or fruiting season, check the smooth gray bark and the leaf arrangement to help identify it"

      reproductive_activity: "Fruits mature; occasional second flowering"
      identification_tips: "Bright red fruit clusters and fall leaf color; sometimes second set of bracts"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for bright red berry clusters that look like tiny apples in bunches, and sometimes the tree makes a second batch of white stars"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree loses all leaves; distinctive branching pattern clearly visible"

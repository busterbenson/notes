  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A fast-growing pine native to a small area of California's central coast, with distinctive needles in bundles of three, large asymmetrical cones, and an open, spreading crown. It's one of the most widely planted pines in the world despite its limited natural range."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of three (sometimes two); large, asymmetrical cones that remain attached to branches for years; broad, spreading crown"
    secondary_markers: "Bright green, rather soft needles about 4-6 inches long; reddish-brown, furrowed bark; cones with uneven development on windward vs. leeward sides"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as lighter green 'candles'"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Bishop Pine, has larger cones; unlike Knobcone Pine, cones are not attached to the trunk; unlike Ponderosa Pine, has shorter needles and cones remain attached longer"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with bright green needles in bundles of three and large woody cones that look different on each side"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's wearing a big green puffy coat, and its cones look like little spiky pineapples stuck to the branches for years"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel softer and more flexible than many other pines - they bend easily when you touch them gently"
    smell_tip: "Carefully smell the needles for a fresh, sweet pine scent (no need to crush them)"
    fun_fact: "Monterey Pine may be rare in the wild, growing naturally in just three tiny spots on California's coast, but it's one of the most widely planted trees in the world! In countries like New Zealand, Chile, and Australia, it's grown on huge tree farms covering millions of acres - that's even more than all the forests in some U.S. states!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles. Do they grow in bundles of 3 (three needles connected at the base)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If there are 2 needles per bundle, check Bishop Pine; if 5 needles, it might be Sugar Pine"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the cones on the tree or on the ground. Are they large (bigger than a lemon) with spiky bumps that are bigger on one side than the other?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If cones are smaller or grow directly on the trunk, check Knobcone Pine"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the needles bright green and softer/more flexible than typical pine needles?"
        yes_next: "You found a Monterey Pine!"
        no_next: "If needles are stiff and sharp, check Ponderosa Pine; if the tree is growing far from the coast, it might be another three-needle pine"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as light green 'candles' at branch tips; male pollen cones produce yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new growth at branch tips and small yellow pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green 'candles' growing at the tips of branches - these will become new needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to bright green; developing cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones grow larger and begin to develop woody scales"
      identification_tips: "Young cones are green to purplish, becoming woody by late summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and small green or purple baby cones start to form"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature but typically remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Older needles may drop, creating a layer of needle litter beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is quiet time for Monterey Pine - it stays green while other trees change color"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity until late winter"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen form stands out when deciduous trees are bare; persistent cones remain visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its green needles when other trees lose their leaves"

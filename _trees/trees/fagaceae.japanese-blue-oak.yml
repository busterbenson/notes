  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen oak with distinctive bluish-green, leathery leaves that are serrated edges. The bark is dark gray and smooth when young, becoming furrowed with age, and the tree forms a dense, rounded crown with horizontal branching."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Glossy, blue-green leaves with serrated edges; evergreen habit"
    secondary_markers: "Dark gray bark; acorns with cup covering 1/3 of nut; new growth often with reddish tint"
    seasonal_markers: "New foliage appears in spring with reddish or bronze coloration; acorns mature in autumn of the second year"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Live Oak, has less spiny leaf margins and more bluish color; unlike Cork Oak, has thinner bark and more serrated leaf edges"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf color. Are they a shiny blue-green color?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Japanese Blue Oak - check other oak species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf edges. Do they have tiny teeth (especially on the upper half) instead of lobes?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have lobes, it might be a different oak species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check if the tree keeps its leaves all year. Does it stay green in winter?"
        yes_next: "You found a Japanese Blue Oak!"
        no_next: "If it drops all its leaves in winter, it's not a Japanese Blue Oak"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      kid_friendly_tip: "During summer, the tree has a full head of blue-green leaves that provide nice cool shade"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little change in leaf color; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns from previous year's flowers mature and drop"
      identification_tips: "Look for mature acorns with cups covering about 1/3 of the nut"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is acorn time! Look for acorns with shallow cups like tiny hats"

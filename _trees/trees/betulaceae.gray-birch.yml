  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A short-lived, slender deciduous tree with distinctive chalky white bark that doesn't peel extensively. Features triangular leaves with long pointed tips and doubly serrated edges. Often grows in a leaning or multi-stemmed form, frequently colonizing disturbed areas in northeastern North America."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Chalky white bark with dark horizontal lines (lenticels) that doesn't peel extensively; triangular leaves with long, tapering points"
    secondary_markers: "Often grows at an angle or with multiple stems; leaves with double-toothed edges; black triangular markings at branch bases"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow fall foliage; visible horizontal dark lines on white bark year-round; dangling catkins in spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree with bright white bark marked with dark horizontal lines that look like smiles"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree often leans like it's tired, with chalk-white bark that has dark dash marks like someone drew them with a marker"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - it's smooth and chalky, but doesn't peel off in big strips like paper birch"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a mild, fresh scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Gray Birch is a pioneer tree - that means it's really good at growing in places where other trees can't, like after a forest fire or where land has been cleared. It helps prepare the soil for bigger trees to grow later!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it bright white with dark horizontal stripes or dashes?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Gray Birch - their white bark with dark lines is their most noticeable feature"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the shape of the tree. Does it often lean to one side or have multiple trunks rather than growing straight up?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "It might still be a Gray Birch, but they often grow at angles rather than straight"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check a leaf. Does it have a triangle shape with a long pointed tip, like a stretched-out triangle?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch - Gray Birch leaves have distinctive long, pointed tips"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaf edges. Do they have tiny double teeth, like a saw with small and big teeth?"
        yes_next: "You found a Gray Birch!"
        no_next: "Not a Gray Birch - their leaves have distinct double-toothed edges"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge light green; hanging male catkins release yellow pollen; smaller female catkins develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release pollen; female catkins receive pollen and begin developing seeds"
      identification_tips: "Drooping male catkins; fresh triangular leaves with pointed tips emerging"

      reproductive_activity: "Seeds develop in cylindrical female catkins"
      identification_tips: "White bark with dark horizontal lines contrasts with dark green triangular leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the tree is covered with triangle-shaped leaves, and its white trunk really stands out"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow; winged seeds are released from catkins"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds disperse with wind"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color; distinctive shape of leaves remains obvious"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow like lemon drops, and tiny seeds with wings float away in the wind"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal white bark with dark horizontal lines; slender buds visible on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; male catkins that will open in spring are already formed"
      identification_tips: "White bark with dark horizontal lines is highly visible in winter; often has a leaning growth habit"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can easily see the white trunk with dark lines like someone drew on it with a marker"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A fast-growing deciduous tree with distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are glossy dark green and sharply toothed. It produces catkins in early spring and small woody cone-like fruits that persist through winter. Native to southern Italy and Corsica, it's valued for its attractive foliage, ability to fix nitrogen, and tolerance of poor soils."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Heart-shaped leaves that are extra shiny, like they've been polished"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like valentine hearts with pointed tips and shiny green surfaces"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth and leathery, almost plastic-like when you touch them"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild, fresh scent"
    fun_fact: "Italian Alder is a superhero tree with special powers! It can grow in places where other trees can't, like poor soil. It has special bacteria in its roots that act like tiny factories, taking nitrogen from the air and turning it into natural plant food in the soil. This helps not just the alder but all the plants growing nearby!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they heart-shaped with a glossy, shiny surface?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the leaves aren't heart-shaped or aren't shiny, it might be a different kind of alder"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for small woody cone-like fruits about the size of a marble. Can you find any on the tree or on the ground underneath?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it's early spring, look for hanging catkins instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it relatively smooth and gray?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the bark is very rough or deeply furrowed, it might be an older tree or a different species"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Does the tree have a pyramid shape (when young) or rounded crown (when older)?"
        yes_next: "You found an Italian Alder!"
        no_next: "Check the leaf edges - they should have small, sharp teeth all around"

  look_alike_species:

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "One of the rarest pine species in the world, growing naturally in only two small areas in coastal California. It has long needles in bundles of five, large woody cones, and a distinctive spreading, often wind-sculpted crown."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Very long needles (8-13 inches) in bundles of five; large, heavy cones; grows only in two specific coastal locations naturally"
    secondary_markers: "Thick, furrowed, reddish-brown bark; broad, spreading crown often shaped by coastal winds; needles thick and stiff"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as light green 'candles'"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike other five-needle pines like Sugar Pine or Western White Pine, has much thicker, more robust needles and a coastal habitat; unlike Monterey Pine, has needles in fives rather than threes"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with super long needles that come in bundles of five, and large heavy pinecones"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles are so long they look like green spaghetti growing in bunches of exactly five strands, and the pinecones are about the size of a baseball"
    touch_tip: "The needles are thick and stiff but not sharp - you can safely run your finger along them"
    smell_tip: "Gently sniff the needles for a fresh, clean pine smell (no need to crush them)"
    fun_fact: "Torrey Pines are super rare treasure trees! They only grow naturally in two tiny spots in the whole world - one near San Diego and one on a small island off the coast. That's like having a tree that only grows in your neighborhood and nowhere else on Earth! Scientists think these trees used to grow in many more places thousands of years ago, but as the climate changed, they survived only in these two special spots."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles. Do they grow in bundles of exactly 5 (five needles connected at the base) and are they very long (longer than a pencil)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Torrey Pine - if there are 3 needles per bundle, check Monterey Pine; if the needles are shorter, check other five-needle pines like Sugar Pine"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree's location. Is it growing near the coast in San Diego County, on Santa Rosa Island, or planted in a park or garden?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Torrey Pine - in nature, they only grow in two specific coastal areas"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the pinecones. Are they large (about the size of a baseball), heavy, and have pointy scales?"
        yes_next: "You found a Torrey Pine!"
        no_next: "If the cones are much larger with curved scales, it might be a Sugar Pine; if much smaller, check other pine species"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as light green 'candles' at branch tips; male pollen cones produce yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new growth at branch tips and small yellow pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green 'candles' growing at the tips of branches - these will become new super-long needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to deep green; developing cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones grow larger and begin to develop woody scales"
      identification_tips: "Young green cones becoming visible as they develop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and baby pinecones start to form"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Older needles may drop, creating a layer of long needle litter beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, some of the oldest needles turn yellow and fall off, but most stay green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; mature cones may release seeds during winter storms"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen form stands out against winter landscape; large cones remain visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its green needles when other trees lose their leaves"

    - species: "Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata)"
      differences: "Monterey Pine has needles in bundles of three, not five, and different cone structure"
      identification_tip: "Count the needles in each bundle - Torrey Pine always has five, never three"

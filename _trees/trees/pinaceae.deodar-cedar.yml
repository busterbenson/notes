  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A majestic evergreen tree with blue-green needles in clusters and gracefully drooping branch tips. It forms a broad pyramid shape with a straight central trunk, and has upright barrel-shaped cones that sit like candles on the branches."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-green needles in clusters on short shoots; distinctively drooping branch tips"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A Christmas-tree shape with droopy branch tips, like it's tired or sad"
    memorable_comparison: "Its branches droop at the ends like they're tired, and the needles grow in little tufts like tiny star bursts"
    touch_tip: "The needles are softer than they look - gently touch the sides rather than the pointy tips"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a sweet, resiny scent like a forest"
    fun_fact: "Deodar Cedar's name comes from the Sanskrit word 'devadaru,' which means 'timber of the gods.' In India, these trees are sacred and often planted around temples. Some Deodar Cedars can live for over 1,000 years!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the branch tips. Do they droop downward like they're tired or sad?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the branch tips point up or straight out, it might be a different cedar species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the needles grow. Are they in tufts or clusters along the branches, like little stars?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles grow singly or in exact bundles (like 2 or 5), it's not a cedar"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the color of the needles. Are they blue-green or silvery-green?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If they're dark green without any blue tint, it might be a different cedar species"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If there are cones, do they stand upright on the branches instead of hanging down?"
        yes_next: "You found a Deodar Cedar!"
        no_next: "If the cones hang down, it's not a cedar - try checking for a pine or spruce"

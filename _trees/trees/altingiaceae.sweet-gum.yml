  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium to large deciduous tree with star-shaped leaves that turn brilliant fall colors of red, orange, purple, and yellow. It produces distinctive spiky, ball-shaped seed pods that fall to the ground and is often planted as a street or shade tree. The tree gets its name from the sweet-smelling gum or sap that oozes from the bark if it's wounded."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Star-shaped leaves with 5-7 pointed lobes; spiky, ball-shaped seed pods; spectacular fall color in reds, oranges, and purples"
    secondary_markers: "Corky ridges on twigs and branches; straight, tall trunk with gray-brown bark that develops deep furrows with age"
    seasonal_markers: "Amazing multicolored fall foliage; spiky seed pods that persist through winter; star-shaped leaves in summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Similar star-shaped leaves to maples, but sweet gum leaves are arranged alternately on the stem (not opposite); spiky seed balls are completely unique"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Star-shaped leaves and spiky ball seed pods that hurt if you step on them barefoot"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like starfish with 5-7 arms, and the seed pods look like tiny spiky maces from a medieval knight"
    touch_tip: "Carefully pick up a seed pod (don't squeeze too hard!) to feel the spiky texture; leaves feel smooth but slightly leathery"
    smell_tip: "If you find a broken twig, you might smell a sweet, pleasant scent from the sap"
    fun_fact: "The spiky seed pods are called 'gumballs' or 'space bugs' by kids who play with them. Sweet gum trees can have beautiful rainbow-colored leaves in fall, with different branches showing red, orange, yellow, and purple all at the same time!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they shaped like stars with 5-7 pointed lobes?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Sweet Gum - try maples for similar star-shaped leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow on the branches. Are they staggered (alternate) instead of paired (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Sweet Gum - might be a maple which has opposite leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look on the ground or in the tree for spiky ball-shaped seed pods about the size of a ping pong ball"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's early in the season, the pods might not have formed yet. Check the twigs for corky ridges."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In fall, do the leaves turn bright colors like red, orange, purple, or yellow?"
        yes_next: "You found a Sweet Gum!"
        no_next: "If it's not fall yet, look for the distinctive spiky seed pods and star-shaped leaves"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Maple Trees (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maples have opposite leaves (pairs directly across from each other); don't have spiky seed balls but winged 'helicopter' seeds"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves grow opposite each other instead of alternate, it's a maple, not a sweet gum"
    - species: "Sycamore/Plane Tree (Platanus species)"
      differences: "Sycamore leaves are less deeply lobed; bark peels in patches showing light colors beneath; has hanging round seed balls that aren't spiky"
      identification_tip: "Sycamores have peeling bark with light patches and fuzzy (not spiky) seed balls"
    - species: "London Plane Tree (Platanus Ã— acerifolia)"
      differences: "Similar sized tree but with less pointed leaf lobes; peeling bark; fuzzy not spiky seed balls"
      identification_tip: "If the bark peels in patches and the seed balls aren't spiky, it's a London Plane not a Sweet Gum"
      
  seasonal_timeline:

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Spectacular color change to red, orange, purple, and yellow"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pods mature and begin to dry"
      identification_tips: "Fall color and mature seed pods are most distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is the most amazing time - the leaves turn rainbow colors and the spiky balls turn brown"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Loses leaves, revealing branching pattern and seed pods"
      reproductive_activity: "Dried seed pods often remain on tree"
      identification_tips: "Persistent seed pods on bare branches; corky twigs"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the tree loses its leaves but keeps its spiky balls. Look for star-shaped leaf buds getting ready for spring."

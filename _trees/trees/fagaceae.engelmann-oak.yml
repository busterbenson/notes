  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue-gray leaves with smooth edges"
    memorable_comparison: "Leaves look like oval blue-gray paddle shapes, not spiky like other oak trees"
    touch_tip: "Feel how thick and leathery the leaves are - they're tough like plastic and help the tree save water during hot summers"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild woody scent"
    fun_fact: "These trees are sometimes called 'Blue Oaks' because their special bluish leaves help them survive hot, dry summers. Some Engelmann Oaks are over 300 years old - they were growing before the United States was even a country!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they blue-gray-green with smooth or only slightly wavy edges (not spiky)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an Engelmann Oak - if leaves are dark green with spiky edges, check Coast Live Oak"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree shape. Is it medium-sized with a broad, open crown that lets light through?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be an Engelmann Oak - check other oak species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check where the tree is growing. Is it on a hillside or in a valley away from the immediate coast in Southern California?"
        yes_next: "You found an Engelmann Oak!"
        no_next: "Might be another oak species since Engelmann Oaks only grow in Southern California foothills"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaf growth emerges, slightly lighter and more silvery in color"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins (pollen structures) appear, releasing yellow pollen"
      identification_tips: "Look for hanging yellow-green catkins and new leaf growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright new leaves and hanging yellow 'tassels' that spread pollen"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full size with mature blue-gray-green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Small acorns developing but still green"
      identification_tips: "Blue-gray leaf color most distinctive; small developing acorns visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the leaves turn their special blue-gray color to help the tree save water"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Acorns turn brown and mature; tree maintains most of its leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns ripen and drop from tree"
      identification_tips: "Look for fallen acorns beneath the tree; still maintains most leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is acorn season! Look for acorns on the ground - they have caps that cover just the top like little hats"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "May lose some leaves during cold periods but generally stays leafy"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "More open appearance if some leaves drop; new buds forming"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees might lose all their leaves, Engelmann Oak keeps most of its leaves through winter"

      differences: "Interior Live Oak has smaller, shinier dark green leaves with more pronounced teeth on the edges"
      identification_tip: "Interior Live Oak leaves are shinier, darker green, and often more pointed than Engelmann Oak's blue-gray leaves"
    - species: "Scrub Oak (Quercus berberidifolia)"
      differences: "Scrub Oak is a shrub rather than a tree, rarely exceeding 15 feet, with more rigid, often prickly leaves"
      identification_tip: "If it's shrubby and short rather than a full tree, it's likely Scrub Oak, not Engelmann Oak"

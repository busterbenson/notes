  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree known for its distinctive chalky white bark that peels in horizontal, paper-like strips. Has oval to triangular leaves with doubly serrated edges, and produces long, dangling catkins in spring. The bright golden-yellow fall color stands out vividly against the white bark."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Peeling, paper-like white bark that you can gently peel like nature's paper"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's wrapped in white paper that's peeling off in strips"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels like thin layers of paper that can peel away"
    smell_tip: "The bark doesn't have a strong smell, but the leaves have a fresh, green scent"
    fun_fact: "People have used paper birch bark for thousands of years to make canoes, containers, and even to write on - it's nature's paper!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it white with horizontal lines and peeling like paper?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Paper Birch - their white, peeling bark is their most noticeable feature"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a pointed egg with tiny double teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch or tree - check the leaf shape and edge carefully"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "How are the leaves arranged on the branch? Do they alternate (zigzag pattern) rather than grow directly across from each other?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Paper Birch - their leaves grow in an alternating pattern"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In spring, do you see long, dangling catkins that look like little caterpillars hanging from branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Paper Birch!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Paper Birch, but look for catkins in spring to be sure"

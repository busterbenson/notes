  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A majestic evergreen tree with blue-green needles growing in tufts along the branches. It has distinctive upright barrel-shaped cones that stand like candles and develops a flat-topped crown when mature."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-green needles in clusters (rosettes) on short shoots; upright barrel-shaped cones"
    secondary_markers: "Needles are stiff and somewhat prickly; older trees develop a distinctive flat-topped crown"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays evergreen with new growth appearing lighter green in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Stiffer needles and more upright branches than Deodar Cedar; needles grow in clusters unlike pines, which grow in bundles"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue-green needles growing in tufts like little stars, with cones standing up like candles"
    memorable_comparison: "Its needles grow in pom-poms and the cones stand up straight instead of hanging down"
    touch_tip: "Careful! The needles are stiff and can poke - gently touch the sides of needles rather than the tips"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a woody, slightly sweet scent like a forest after rain"
    fun_fact: "Atlas Cedars can live for over 1,000 years! The oldest ones grow in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, which is how they got their name."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the needles grow. Do they come out in little tufts or clusters along the branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the needles grow singly or in bundles of exact numbers (like 2 or 5), it's not an Atlas Cedar"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the color of the needles. Are they blue-green or silvery-blue rather than dark green?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If they're dark green without any blue tint, it might be a different cedar species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If there are cones, look at how they're positioned. Do they stand upright on the branches instead of hanging down?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the cones hang down, it's not an Atlas Cedar - try checking for Deodar Cedar or another conifer"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the overall tree shape. If it's older, does it have a flat top rather than a pointy top?"
        yes_next: "You found an Atlas Cedar!"
        no_next: "It could still be a young Atlas Cedar - check other features like needle color and arrangement"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara)"
      differences: "Deodar Cedar has drooping branch tips and softer, longer needles; Atlas Cedar has stiffer needles and more upright branch tips"

    - species: "Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus libani)"
      differences: "Very similar, but Lebanon Cedar often has darker green needles and typically develops a flat top earlier"
      identification_tip: "These are hard to tell apart - Lebanon Cedar is less commonly planted in California"

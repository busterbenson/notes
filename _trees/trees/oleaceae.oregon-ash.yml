  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A deciduous tree with compound leaves divided into 5-7 leaflets, found along streams and in wet areas. It has opposite branching, grayish-brown furrowed bark, and winged seeds that spin like helicopters when they fall."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with 5-7 leaflets arranged in opposite pairs; distinctive opposite branching pattern; winged seeds in clusters"
    secondary_markers: "Grayish-brown bark with diamond-shaped furrows; leaflets with toothed edges; seeds hang in clusters"
    seasonal_markers: "Clusters of winged seeds in late summer and fall; bright yellow fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike other ashes, Oregon Ash has 5-7 broad, fuzzy leaflets (not 7-11 narrow leaflets); unlike maples, has compound leaves instead of simple leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with compound leaves that grow exactly opposite each other, and seeds that spin like helicopter propellers when they fall"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches grow like arms raised in a perfect Y shape, and the seeds twirl down like little helicopters"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf undersides - they're slightly fuzzy like a soft blanket"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they feel leathery when mature"
    fun_fact: "Oregon Ash trees love water so much that their roots can survive being underwater for weeks during floods! Native Americans used the wood to make paddles, tool handles, and dishes because it's strong but can be carved when fresh."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at how the branches grow. Do they grow in perfect pairs opposite each other, making Y shapes?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an Oregon Ash - look for trees with alternate branching pattern"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they compound with 5-7 leaflets arranged along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not an Oregon Ash - look at maple trees with similar opposite branching but simple leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seeds with wings (in summer and fall). Do they hang in clusters and spin like helicopters when they fall?"
        yes_next: "You found an Oregon Ash! Look for it growing near water in streams or wet areas."
        no_next: "If it's winter or spring with no seeds visible, check for opposite buds on twigs and diamond-patterned bark."

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A small tree or large shrub known for its bright red winged seeds that look like tiny butterfly wings in summer. Usually grows with multiple stems and has simple, oval leaves with small teeth along the edges, not the deeply lobed shape of typical maple leaves."

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the leaves are arranged on the branches. Do they grow in pairs, directly opposite each other?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Tatarian Maple - might be an oak or other tree with alternate leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the shape of the leaves. Are they oval with small teeth along the edges (not deeply cut like a typical maple leaf)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Tatarian Maple - might be another type of maple with lobed leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In summer, do you see bright red winged seeds (like little red helicopters)? In winter, is it a small tree with multiple trunks?"
        yes_next: "You found a Tatarian Maple!"
        no_next: "Might be a different maple - check the seed color and size again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:

      reproductive_activity: "Samaras (winged seeds) mature and turn bright red, the most distinctive feature"
      identification_tips: "The bright red samaras make summer identification easy and reliable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you'll see the cool bright red helicopter seeds - they look like red butterfly wings!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to red-orange before dropping"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds begin to drop and disperse by wind"
      identification_tips: "Fall color and remnants of red samaras help with identification"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A drought-tolerant, deciduous large shrub or small tree native to dry mountain slopes in western North America, including parts of California. Distinguished by its alder-like leaves with prominent veins and feathery, twisted, long-tailed fruits. Important for wildlife habitat and erosion control on dry slopes."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Alder-like, wedge-shaped leaves with prominent straight veins and toothed edges above the middle; distinctive twisted feathery tails on seeds"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown flaky bark; wedge-shaped leathery leaves with dark green upper surface and pale, hairy lower surface; grows in dry, rocky mountain habitats"
    seasonal_markers: "Small cream to yellowish flowers in spring; feathery, twisted seed tails in summer; gray leafless branches in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Distinguished from true alders by growing in dry habitats, having thicker leaves, and producing long feathery seed tails instead of woody cones; distinguished from birchleaf mountain mahogany by its alder-like leaves rather than birch-like leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that look like little fans with straight lines (veins) and teeth at the top edge, and seeds with long curly feathery tails"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like tiny handheld fans, and the seeds look like they're wearing funny curly pigtails that twist and wave in the wind"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel leathery and a bit stiff on top, but the undersides feel fuzzy like a soft blanket"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a faint pleasant smell, especially when crushed"
    fun_fact: "The seeds of this plant have special curly tails that work like drills! When the wind blows them to the ground, the tails twist and untwist with changes in moisture, drilling the seed into the soil to help it grow in dry, rocky places."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Is the plant growing in a dry, sunny place on a mountain slope or hillside?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's growing in a wet area by a stream, it's probably not an Alderleaf Cercocarpus"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they shaped like little fans with straight lines (veins) running from the narrow bottom to the wider top, with teeth only at the top half?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have a different shape or teeth all around the edge, it might be another plant"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is it a shrub or small tree (shorter than a one-story house) with multiple stems?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's a tall tree with a single trunk, it's probably not an Alderleaf Cercocarpus"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In late spring or summer, do you see seeds with long (1-2 inch) feathery, twisted tails attached to them?"
        yes_next: "You found an Alderleaf Cercocarpus!"
        no_next: "If it's not seed season, turn over a leaf - if the bottom is paler and slightly fuzzy, it might be an Alderleaf Cercocarpus"
  
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge with a light green color; small, cream to yellowish flowers appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom, typically without showy petals"
      identification_tips: "Look for new wedge-shaped leaves with prominent straight veins and small flowers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for new fan-shaped leaves and tiny flowers without petals - they're not showy but bees still visit them!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full size and darken to leathery dark green on top, pale and fuzzy underneath; feathery seed tails develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds develop their distinctive long, feathery, twisted tails"
      identification_tips: "The distinctive feathery seed tails make summer identification easy"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, look for the funny twisted 'pigtails' on the seeds that help them drill into the ground"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves may turn yellowish to brown before falling; seed tails may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds disperse, carried by wind with their feathery tails"
      identification_tips: "Combination of wedge-shaped leaves and any remaining feathery seed tails"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow or brown, and the seeds fly away with their feathery tails to find new places to grow"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leaves drop, revealing gray-brown branches and flaky bark"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant during winter"
      identification_tips: "Multiple stems, flaky bark, and often some persistent seed tails"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you might still find some curly seed tails attached to the bare branches"

      differences: "Birchleaf Mountain Mahogany has smaller, more birch-like leaves compared to the alder-like leaves of C. montanus; both have similar feathery seed tails"
      identification_tip: "Check the leaf shape - more rounded for birchleaf, more wedge-shaped for alderleaf"
    
    - species: "White Alder (Alnus rhombifolia)"
      differences: "White Alder grows near water, not on dry slopes; produces woody cone-like fruits rather than feathery seed tails"

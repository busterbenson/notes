  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A deciduous ornamental tree with attractive oval leaves, white spring flowers, and bright orange-red fall berries. Native to East Asia but planted in California landscapes for its beautiful foliage, flowers, and fall color. Distinguished by its alder-like leaves that turn vibrant red and orange in autumn."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Oval, alder-like leaves with doubly serrated edges; clusters of small white flowers in spring; bright orange-red berries in fall"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark when young, developing shallow fissures with age; compact oval to rounded crown; brilliant red-orange fall color"
    seasonal_markers: "White flower clusters in spring; glossy green leaves in summer; bright orange-red berries and foliage in fall; bare branches with visible buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike true alders, produces colorful berries; unlike mountain ash, has simple not compound leaves; unlike European whitebeam, has more deeply toothed leaf margins"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that look like alders but with bright orange-red berries in fall"
    memorable_comparison: "In fall, this tree looks like it's holding hundreds of tiny pumpkins among its red and orange leaves"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly rough on top but softer on the bottom side"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell in spring"
    fun_fact: "This tree got its name because its leaves look like alder tree leaves, but it's actually related to apples and roses! The tiny fruits look like miniature apples about the size of a pea."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they oval-shaped with jagged double teeth around the edges, almost like tiny saws?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "This is probably not an Alder Whitebeam - check for different leaf shapes"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "In spring, do you see clusters of small white flowers? In fall, do you see bright orange-red berry-like fruits about the size of peas?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it's not flowering or fruiting season, look at the overall tree shape and bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree medium-sized (about 20-40 feet tall) with a rounded crown and smooth grayish bark when young?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another tree with similar leaves or fruits - check the size and shape"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In fall, do the leaves turn bright red to orange?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "If it's not fall yet, check if the tree is in a landscape setting like a park or yard rather than a wild forest"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "Is the tree growing in a park, yard, or along a street rather than in a wild forest?"
        yes_next: "You found an Alder Whitebeam!"
        no_next: "Alder Whitebeams are usually planted by people in landscaped areas in California, not found in wild areas"
  
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge with a bronze tint before turning green; clusters of white flowers appear"

      identification_tips: "Look for flat-topped clusters of white flowers among the new green leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tree puts on a pretty white flower show with bunches of small white blooms!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Dark green, glossy leaves form a dense canopy; small green fruits begin developing and gradually turn orange-red"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers fade and small fruits develop and grow"
      identification_tips: "Glossy, dark green leaves with double-toothed edges; developing fruits visible by late summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "During summer, the tree has shiny green leaves and you can watch the tiny fruits start to change from green to orange"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn brilliant red to orange; fruits fully ripen to bright orange-red"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruits fully mature and attract birds"
      identification_tips: "Bright fall color and presence of orange-red berry-like fruits"
      kid_friendly_tip: "The leaves turn amazing red and orange colors in fall, and the branches hold lots of tiny orange-red berries that look like miniature pumpkins!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Branches bare, showing smooth gray bark on young trees or slightly furrowed bark on older specimens; some fruits may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds form for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Smooth gray bark on younger trees; some bright fruits may remain into winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "After the leaves fall off, you might still see some bright orange-red fruits hanging on the bare branches, and the bark looks smooth and gray"

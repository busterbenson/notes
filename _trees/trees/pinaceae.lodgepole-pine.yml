  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A versatile and widely distributed pine tree with short needles in bundles of two, small prickly cones that often remain closed for years, and thin, scaly bark. It forms dense, even-aged stands after fire and can grow as a tall, straight tree or as a twisted, stunted form depending on its environment."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of two, short (1-3 inches); small egg-shaped cones with prickly scales; thin, scaly bark that's orange-brown inside cracks"
    secondary_markers: "Often grows in dense, even-aged stands; slender trunk and narrow crown in forests; small cones often remain attached and closed for many years"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as light green 'candles'"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Ponderosa Pine, has much shorter needles and smaller cones; unlike Jeffrey Pine, has prickly cones and shorter needles; unlike Shore Pine (a subspecies), grows straight and tall rather than twisted and spreading"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with short needles that grow in pairs and small pinecones with prickly points that often stay on the tree for years"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like short green pencils that always come in pairs, and the small pinecones are like spiky eggs that often stay stuck to the branches for a long time"
    touch_tip: "The needles are stiff but not super sharp, and they always grow in pairs - if you hold a bundle, you'll feel exactly two needles"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a fresh pine scent"
    fun_fact: "Lodgepole Pines are fire superheroes! Their pinecones have a special superpower - they're sealed shut with a sticky resin and can stay closed for 20 years or more, waiting for a forest fire. When fire comes, the heat melts the resin and the cones pop open like popcorn, dropping seeds onto the freshly cleared ground. This is why you often see thousands of baby Lodgepole Pines all the same size growing together after a fire - they're all fire babies!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles. Do they grow in bundles of exactly 2 (just two needles connected at the base) and are they short (only about 1-3 inches long)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Lodgepole Pine - if needles are in bundles of 3 or 5, or if they're much longer than 3 inches, check other pine species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the cones on the tree or on the ground. Are they small (about the size of an egg), egg-shaped, with prickly points on the scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If cones are larger or don't have prickly points, check other pine species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at how the trees are growing. Are there many trees of the same size growing close together, or is the tree growing in a mountain or forest setting?"
        yes_next: "You found a Lodgepole Pine!"
        no_next: "If you're near the coast and the tree is twisted and spreading rather than straight, it might be Shore Pine (a type of Lodgepole Pine)"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and baby pinecones start to form"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature but often remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Mature brown cones visible; some needle drop creates a layer of needle litter"

    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"

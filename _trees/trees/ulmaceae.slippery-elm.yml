  summary: Slippery Elm is a tree that loses its leaves in winter and is shaped like a vase or fountain. It has big leaves that feel rough like sandpaper on both sides, with jagged double teeth around the edges. The tree gets its name from its special inner bark that feels slippery and gooey when wet - which has been used as medicine for hundreds of years! Though not originally from California, you might find it in parks and old neighborhoods, where you can recognize it by its large, rough leaves and deeply grooved bark.

  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Vase-shaped tree with large leaves (as long as your hand) that feel rough like sandpaper on BOTH sides"
    secondary_markers: "Leaves have jagged double teeth around the edges and one side of the leaf base is bigger than the other"
    seasonal_markers: "Small reddish-green flower clusters in early spring before leaves appear; flat, round, papery seeds in late spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American Elm, has rough leaves on both sides, not just the top; unlike Chinese Elm, has much larger leaves and lacks patchy, peeling bark"

  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Big leaves that feel like sandpaper on BOTH sides"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like a fountain with branches spraying up and out from the trunk"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel both sides of a leaf - they're rough like sandpaper or a cat's tongue, and much rougher than most other tree leaves"
    smell_tip: "No special smell in the leaves, but if you could see the inner bark (don't hurt the tree to check!), it would be reddish and feel slippery when wet"
    fun_fact: "The inner bark makes a slippery, gooey substance that Native Americans and early settlers used as medicine for sore throats and upset stomachs. Even today, some throat lozenges still use Slippery Elm!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Does it grow like a fountain or vase, with branches arching up and out?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Slippery Elm - look at other trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they big (longer than your hand) with jagged double teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Slippery Elm - try a different elm or other tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Feel both sides of a leaf. Are they both rough like sandpaper?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Slippery Elm - could be American Elm which is only rough on top"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the base of the leaf where it attaches to the stem. Is one side bigger than the other (asymmetrical)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Slippery Elm!"
        no_next: "Probably not a Slippery Elm - most elms have uneven leaf bases"

  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "First small reddish-green flower clusters appear along branches, then small new leaves emerge light green and grow quickly"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom before leaves emerge; flat, round, papery seeds (samaras) develop and mature by late spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for clusters of small flowers, followed by papery seeds, then rapidly growing leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for tiny reddish flowers before the leaves come out, then lots of little round, flat 'helicopter' seeds"
    
    - season: "Summer"
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full size (as long as your hand) and dark green color, forming a dense leafy canopy"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds have typically fallen by early summer"
      identification_tips: "Look for the large, rough leaves and the distinctive vase shape of the crown"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the tree is full of big, sandpapery leaves that make a shady canopy"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn dull yellow before dropping from the tree"
      reproductive_activity: "No reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Fall color is not impressive - just a dull yellow before leaves drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow but not bright gold like some trees - more like the color of butter that's been left out too long"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "After leaves drop, the fountain or vase shape is easy to see"
      reproductive_activity: "Flower buds develop for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for the graceful, arching branch structure and deeply furrowed bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter when the leaves are gone, you can see the pretty fountain shape of the branches"

  wildlife_value: "Even though it's not from California originally, Slippery Elm can help wildlife if planted in gardens and parks. Birds and small animals like squirrels eat the seeds. Many kinds of butterfly and moth caterpillars eat the leaves, including the pretty Question Mark and Mourning Cloak butterflies. Birds build nests in the branches, and older trees with holes in them provide homes for animals that need tree cavities. Deer sometimes eat the leaves and twigs, especially in winter when food is scarce. The rough bark is home to insects that birds can eat. While not as helpful to California wildlife as trees that naturally grow here, it still provides food and shelter for many animals in city and suburban areas."

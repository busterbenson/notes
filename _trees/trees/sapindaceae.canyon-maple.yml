  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous tree with distinctive lobed leaves that turn brilliant orange-red in fall. Often found in canyons and on mountain slopes, it has a rounded crown, smooth gray bark when young, and paired helicopter-like seeds."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Distinctive palmate (hand-shaped) leaves with 3-5 lobes and large, pointed teeth; paired winged seeds (samaras); opposite branching pattern"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark on young trees; brilliant orange-red fall color; grows in canyons and on mountain slopes in western states"
    seasonal_markers: "Green leaves in spring and summer; bright orange-red fall color; bare branches with opposite buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Bigleaf Maple, has smaller leaves with deeper lobes and teeth; unlike Rocky Mountain Maple, grows taller with a single trunk rather than a multi-stemmed shrub"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree with maple leaves that have big, pointy teeth and turn bright orange-red in fall"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like small hands with 3-5 fingers, and each finger has big pointy teeth; in fall they turn the color of a bright orange-red sunset"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth on top but might have small hairs on the bottom side"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild, sweet scent"
    fun_fact: "Canyon Maple trees are masters of hiding! They love to grow in sheltered mountain canyons where they can find more water and stay protected from harsh weather. In these secret canyon homes, they create spectacular autumn shows with their bright orange-red leaves. They're like nature's hidden treasure that reward hikers who explore deep into the mountains!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if the branches grow directly opposite each other (not alternating). Do they grow in pairs across from each other on the twigs?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Canyon Maple - if branches alternate, check oak or other non-maple species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Does it have a shape like a hand with 3-5 lobes (fingers) and big, pointy teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If leaves are much larger with softer lobes, check Bigleaf Maple; if leaves are compound with separate leaflets, check ash or other species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is it a small tree (about 20-35 feet tall) growing in a mountain canyon or on a rocky slope? In fall, do the leaves turn bright orange-red?"
        yes_next: "You found a Canyon Maple!"
        no_next: "If it's very small and shrub-like with multiple stems, check Rocky Mountain Maple; if it's a large tree with bigger leaves, check Bigleaf Maple"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge light green; small, inconspicuous flowers appear before or with the leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom, typically yellowish-green and in small clusters"
      identification_tips: "Fresh, bright green leaves and opposite branching pattern distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for small, bright green baby leaves that unfold like tiny hands"

      reproductive_activity: "Paired winged seeds (samaras) grow and mature"
      identification_tips: "Look for lobed leaves with large teeth and developing paired seed 'helicopters'"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see the seeds growing in pairs - they look like tiny helicopter propellers"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn brilliant orange-red before dropping; seeds may disperse"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds fully mature and are dispersed by wind"
      identification_tips: "Brilliant fall color is distinctive; paired samaras often still visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves put on a color show, turning bright orange-red before falling off"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leafless; opposite branching pattern clearly visible; buds prominent"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Opposite branching and buds are key winter identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, all the leaves fall off, but you can still identify it by the branches that grow in pairs across from each other"

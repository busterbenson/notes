  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences)
  summary: "A medium to large evergreen oak tree with uniquely thick, spongy bark that is harvested as commercial cork. It has leathery oval leaves with spiny edges and produces acorns like other oaks. Native to the Mediterranean region but planted in California for its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Extremely thick, spongy bark with deep fissures; evergreen oval leaves with spiny edges; acorns with distinctive scaly cups"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown bark that becomes corky and thick with age; leathery leaves with pale undersides; round crown with spreading branches"
    seasonal_markers: "Evergreen foliage year-round; acorns mature in fall; inconspicuous green-yellow flowers in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Live Oak, has distinctively thick, corky bark; unlike Holly Oak, has less spiny leaf edges and thicker bark; unlike deciduous oaks, keeps leaves year-round"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Amazingly thick, spongy bark that feels like a cork bulletin board"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks and feels like the cork boards you pin notes to at school, and the leaves are tough and leathery with prickly edges"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels soft and squishy like a sponge or foam - you can gently press your finger into it and it springs back"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a mild, woody scent if you crush them gently"
    fun_fact: "Cork Oak trees give us the real cork used for bottle stoppers and bulletin boards! The special thick bark can be harvested without hurting the tree, and it grows back every 9-12 years like a renewable resource."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it extremely thick and spongy-looking with deep cracks and a texture like a cork bulletin board?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Cork Oak - no other tree has such thick, corky bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they leathery, oval-shaped, and evergreen with some small spiny teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of oak tree or evergreen tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for acorns or acorn cups under the tree (especially in fall). Do you see acorns with scaly cups like other oak trees?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's not acorn season, check if the tree stays green all year and has thick, corky bark"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Where is the tree growing? Is it planted in a yard, park, or landscape rather than in a wild forest?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "Cork Oaks are not native to California, so they're almost always planted by people"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "If you can reach the bark safely, gently press your finger against it. Does it feel springy and spongy, unlike regular hard tree bark?"
        yes_next: "You found a Cork Oak!"
        no_next: "If the bark is hard rather than spongy, it's probably another type of oak tree"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Fresh new leaves may emerge; small yellowish-green flowers appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Produces inconspicuous pollen-bearing and seed-bearing flowers"
      identification_tips: "Thick, corky bark is the best identifier; look for small catkin-like flowers if present"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, you might see tiny yellow-green flowers hanging down, and some fresh new leaves growing, but the super spongy bark is still the best way to spot it!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of dark green, leathery leaves; acorns begin to develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns grow larger throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Thick, corky bark and leathery evergreen leaves; developing acorns"
      kid_friendly_tip: "During summer, the tree is covered with tough, leathery green leaves, and baby acorns start growing in their little cups"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No major leaf color change; acorns mature and may begin to drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns fully mature and drop from the tree"
      identification_tips: "Mature acorns; unchanging evergreen foliage stands out as deciduous trees change color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees turn red and yellow and lose their leaves in fall, the Cork Oak stays green and drops its acorns"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Retains green leaves through winter with minimal change"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature stands out when deciduous trees are bare; thick distinctive bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, the Cork Oak keeps its green leaves when many other trees are bare, and its spongy cork bark is easy to spot year-round"

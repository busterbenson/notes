  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A distinctive Alaskan variety of paper birch with chalky white bark that peels in thin, paper-like layers. Features oval to triangular leaves with doubly serrated edges and grows with a more compact form than standard paper birch. Native to the Kenai Peninsula and south-central Alaska, with limited adaptability to California's varied climate."

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with bright white bark that peels like paper, and triangular leaves with tiny teeth along the edges"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's wearing a white paper costume that's peeling off; the bark peels like nature's wrapping paper"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels like thin layers of paper that you can carefully peel away"
    smell_tip: "The bark has little smell, but crush a leaf gently to enjoy a light, fresh scent"
    fun_fact: "The Kenai Birch is like a forest superhero from Alaska! Its special white bark was used by Native Alaskans to make baskets, small containers, and even to write messages - it's nature's paper!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it bright white with paper-like strips peeling off?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Kenai Birch - its white, peeling bark is its most obvious feature"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the shape of the tree. Is it smaller and more rounded than other birches you might have seen?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch - Kenai Birch is usually smaller with a more rounded crown"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a pointed egg with tiny zigzag teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Probably not a Kenai Birch - check the leaf shape and double-toothed edges"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Are the leaves arranged in a zigzag pattern along the branch (not directly across from each other)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Kenai Birch! It's a special Alaskan variety of paper birch that's smaller and more compact"
        no_next: "Not a Kenai Birch - all birches have alternating leaves in a zigzag pattern"

  common_name: "Wych Elm"
  scientific_name: "Ulmus glabra"
  family: "Ulmaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "The Wych Elm is a large deciduous tree with a broad, rounded crown and spreading branches. It has large, rough, double-toothed leaves that are asymmetrical at the base, and produces circular winged seeds. The bark is gray-brown and develops deep furrows with age."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Large (3-6 inch), rough leaves with double-toothed edges and asymmetrical bases; branches spread widely with a broad crown; twigs not winged"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown bark with deep furrows on mature trees; flat, circular winged seeds (samaras); leaves rough to touch on top surface"
    seasonal_markers: "Small reddish-purple flowers in tight clusters in early spring before leaves appear; seeds mature and drop by late spring; leaves turn yellow in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American Elm, has rougher, wider leaves with shorter stalks; unlike Winged Elm, lacks corky wings on branches and has much larger leaves; unlike English Elm, has more spreading form rather than upright vase shape"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Very large, rough leaves with uneven bases (one side comes down lower on the leaf stem than the other)"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like big, rough sandpaper sheets with edges that look like tiny shark teeth on bigger shark teeth"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the leaf surface - it's rough like fine sandpaper on top and a bit fuzzy underneath"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they do have a slightly earthy scent if you crush them"
    fun_fact: "Wych Elm is the only elm native to Scotland, and its name 'wych' comes from an old English word meaning 'pliable' - because its wood was used to make bows and wheels!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they large (bigger than your hand), rough, and have double-toothed edges (tiny teeth on bigger teeth)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Wych Elm - check other elm species or trees with similar leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the base of the leaf where it meets the stem. Is one side lower than the other (asymmetrical)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Wych Elm - check other trees with similar leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the branches. Do they spread out widely without any corky wings or ridges along them?"
        yes_next: "You found a Wych Elm!"
        no_next: "If there are corky wings on the branches, it might be a Winged Elm instead"

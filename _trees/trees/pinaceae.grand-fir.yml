  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall, fragrant evergreen tree with flattened needles arranged in a distinct horizontal pattern, upright purple-green cones, and smooth bark with resin blisters. It grows in moist forests and is known for its symmetrical form and shiny, dark green needles."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat needles arranged in horizontal sprays; needles have two white lines on underside; upright cones; strong citrus-like scent when needles are crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark with resin blisters; needles of two distinct lengths; cones grow upright on branches and disintegrate on the tree"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears lighter green; pollen cones release yellow pollen in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike White Fir, has a stronger citrus scent and needles noticeably arranged in horizontal planes; unlike Douglas-fir, has upright cones that disintegrate on the tree rather than hanging cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tall evergreen tree with flat needles arranged in neat horizontal rows that make the branches look like flat ferns"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like perfect flat fans or combs, and if you crush a needle, it smells like oranges or lemons"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and flat - they won't poke you like spruce or some other evergreens"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle and smell a wonderful citrus scent like lemons or oranges"
    fun_fact: "Grand Fir trees are scent magicians! When you crush their needles, they release a smell like lemons or oranges - completely different from what you'd expect from a pine-looking tree. Grand Firs can also grow incredibly tall - up to 250 feet, which is like stacking 25 school buses on top of each other! Their pinecones are special too - instead of falling to the ground whole like most pinecones, they break apart piece by piece while still on the tree, like a nature puzzle coming undone."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the needles are arranged on the branches. Do they spread out to the sides in flat, horizontal sprays like fern fronds?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Grand Fir - if needles stick out all around the twig, check spruce or another conifer"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently crush a needle and smell it. Does it have a strong, pleasant citrus smell like lemons or oranges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it smells more like regular pine or has no strong smell, check another fir species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for cones on the tree. Do they stand upright on top of branches (like candles on a cake) rather than hanging down? They might be greenish-purple when young."
        yes_next: "You found a Grand Fir!"
        no_next: "If the cones hang down, check Douglas-fir; if there are no cones but the other features match, look for cone scales on the ground (Grand Fir cones fall apart on the tree)"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as bright light green at branch tips; pollen cones release yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones release pollen; female cones begin development high in the crown"
      identification_tips: "Bright green new growth contrasts with older darker green needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright lime-green new shoots at the tips of branches, and tiny yellow pollen cones that make yellow dust when you touch them"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to match older foliage; young seed cones visible growing upright on upper branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones grow and develop, typically green to purplish"
      identification_tips: "Upright green to purple cones becoming visible on upper branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see purple-green pinecones standing up like little soldiers on the upper branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change in foliage; cones mature and begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones break apart on the tree, releasing seeds with winged attachments"
      identification_tips: "Look for disintegrating cones and scales scattered beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, something magical happens - instead of falling off whole, the pinecones break apart piece by piece while still on the tree!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive flat needle arrangement remains visible year-round"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it stays green when other trees lose their leaves, and the flat, fan-like branches might collect snow in pretty patterns"

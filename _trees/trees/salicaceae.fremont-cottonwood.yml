  # Basic summary
  summary: "A tall, fast-growing deciduous tree with triangular to heart-shaped leaves that shimmer and rustle in the breeze. Has light gray bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age, and produces fluffy white seeds that float through the air like cotton in spring."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Heart-shaped leaves with toothed edges that wiggle and make noise even in light breeze; light gray bark that becomes deeply furrowed on older trees"
    secondary_markers: "Triangular leaf shape with flattened leaf stem that makes leaves 'dance' in wind; male and female trees with hanging catkins in spring"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright yellow fall color; fluffy cotton-like seeds floating in air during late spring; leaf buds are sticky and fragrant in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike other poplars (like Quaking Aspen), has more triangular/heart-shaped leaves rather than rounded; unlike cottonwoods from eastern states, has more wedge-shaped leaf bases"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Triangle-shaped leaves that 'dance' and make rustling sounds in the wind"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves spin and wiggle like tiny windmills on their flat stems, and in spring the fluffy seeds look like it's snowing cotton balls!"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf stem - it's flat instead of round, which is why the leaves wiggle so much in the breeze"
    smell_tip: "In spring, carefully smell the sticky leaf buds - they have a sweet smell like honey or maple syrup"
    fun_fact: "These trees can drink over 200 gallons of water every day! That's like filling up a bathtub daily. Their seeds are so light and fluffy they can float in the air for miles, which is why these trees are often the first to grow in new areas near water."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf shape - is it triangular or heart-shaped with toothed edges?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Fremont Cottonwood - look at other deciduous trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Make the 'wind test' - do the leaves dance and make noise even in a light breeze?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of poplar - check the bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the tree bark - is it light gray, either smooth on young trees or deeply grooved on older ones?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Fremont Cottonwood - might be another type of poplar or cottonwood"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree growing near water like a river, stream, or in a wet area (unless it was planted in a yard)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Fremont Cottonwood!"
        no_next: "If it's not near water and wasn't planted by people, it's probably not a Fremont Cottonwood"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Sticky buds open into bright green leaves; drooping catkins (flower clusters) appear before leaves fully grow; females produce green seed capsules that later burst open with cottony seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Male trees produce reddish-purple hanging catkins; female trees produce greenish catkins that develop into seed capsules"
      identification_tips: "Look for the hanging catkins, sticky leaf buds, and later the cottony seeds flying through the air"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for sticky buds, hanging catkins that look like fuzzy caterpillars, and later, fluffy white cotton floating everywhere!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of triangular green leaves that rustle and shimmer in the wind; cottony seed dispersal ends"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds have already been released; tree focuses on growing"
      identification_tips: "Identify by the dancing triangular leaves and the rustling sound in summer breezes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you'll hear the leaves 'talking' in the wind - listen for the whispers and rustling sounds"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright golden yellow; eventually all leaves fall off for winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree prepares for dormancy; next year's buds begin to form"
      identification_tips: "The bright yellow fall color makes these trees easy to spot along streams and rivers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the tree puts on a golden light show! All the leaves turn bright yellow like they're trying to copy the sun"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; gray bark more visible; pointed leaf buds visible on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds getting ready for spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for the light gray bark, thick trunk, and pointed buds on bare branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the tree takes a nap! Look for the light gray bark and pointy sleeping buds on the branches"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides)"

    - species: "Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides)"
      differences: "Not native to California but sometimes planted; very similar but leaf bases form a flatter angle (not as heart-shaped); leaf stems typically shorter"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous tree with white to grayish bark that doesn't peel as much as paper birch. It has oval to diamond-shaped leaves with doubly serrated edges, and young twigs and leaf stems covered with tiny soft hairs (giving it the 'downy' name)."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "White to grayish bark and soft, fuzzy young twigs and leaf stems"
    memorable_comparison: "The young twigs and leaf stems feel like they have baby-soft fuzz on them - that's why it's called 'downy'"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the young twigs and leaf stems - they should feel soft and fuzzy like a stuffed animal"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a mild, fresh scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Downy Birch trees can easily grow where other trees struggle! They're one of the first trees to grow back after a forest fire, and they can even grow in boggy areas where their roots are almost completely underwater!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it white to grayish-white but not peeling much?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark peels a lot in thin curls, check for Paper Birch instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently touch the young twigs or leaf stems. Do they feel slightly fuzzy or hairy?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the twigs are smooth and have no hairs, check for Silver Birch or other birches"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Are they oval to diamond-shaped with double-toothed edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the leaves have a different shape, it might be another birch species"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the leaves turning yellow? In spring, do you see hanging catkins?"
        yes_next: "You found a Downy Birch!"
        no_next: "It still might be a Downy Birch, but check that it has both white bark and fuzzy twigs"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

      identification_tips: "Fully developed leaves; white bark contrasts with green leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the leaves are fully grown but you can still feel the softness on leaf stems"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright yellow; small seed catkins mature and break apart to release seeds"

      identification_tips: "Bright yellow fall color; new male catkins visible for next spring"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn bright yellow like sunshine, and you can see next year's catkins starting to form"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal white bark and dark twigs; male catkins persist through winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; male catkins wait until spring to release pollen"
      identification_tips: "White bark stands out in winter landscape; male catkins visible; fine branching pattern"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can easily see the white trunk and branches against the sky, with little catkins hanging like decorations"

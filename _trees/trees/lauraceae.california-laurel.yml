  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that smell like pepper and eucalyptus when crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "The smell is like a mix of bay leaves used in cooking and cough drops"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth and leathery the leaves are - they're shiny on top and a little duller underneath"
    smell_tip: "GENTLY crush a leaf between your fingers and smell - but watch out, it's strong and can give you a headache if you smell too much!"
    fun_fact: "Native American tribes used these leaves for medicine, food flavoring, and to keep away fleas and insects. The wood is beautiful for furniture, and some people call it 'California Bay' and use the leaves for cooking just like the bay leaves you might find in your kitchen spice rack."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they smooth-edged, shiny, and evergreen?"

        no_next: "Not a California Laurel - try looking for other trees with different leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "GENTLY crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a very strong spicy smell like pepper or eucalyptus?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a California Laurel - check out other trees with different smelling leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the fruits if present. Are they small and olive-shaped?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Laurel!"
        no_next: "Might be California Laurel - check the leaf smell again"

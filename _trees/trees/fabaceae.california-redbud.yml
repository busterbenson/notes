  # Basic summary
  summary: "A small, multi-trunked deciduous tree or large shrub with heart-shaped leaves and stunning magenta flowers that bloom directly on branches before leaves appear in spring. It produces flat, papery seedpods that start green, turn reddish-purple, then brown."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bright magenta pea-like flowers growing directly on bare branches in early spring; perfect heart-shaped leaves; flat, papery seedpods"
    secondary_markers: "Multi-trunked growth form; smooth gray bark on young trees; blue-green to green heart-shaped leaves with smooth edges"
    seasonal_markers: "Spectacular pink-purple flowers in early spring before leaves; green heart-shaped leaves in summer; yellow to orange fall color; seedpods persist into winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis), California Redbud has smaller, more blue-green leaves and is more drought-tolerant; unlike other heart-shaped leaf trees, has distinctive pea-like flowers and flat seedpods"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches covered with bright pink-purple flowers in spring before leaves appear, followed by perfect heart-shaped leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "In spring, it looks like someone hung tiny pink butterflies all over the branches; the leaves are shaped just like Valentine's Day hearts"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth, heart-shaped leaves - they're not fuzzy, just smooth like paper. The flat seedpods feel like thin paper too."
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell if you gently sniff them, but they're more special to look at than to smell"
    fun_fact: "The flowers grow right out of the branches and even the trunk, not just at the tips! This special way of flowering is called 'cauliflory' and makes it look like the tree is wearing a coat of pink butterflies in spring."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "In spring, do you see a small tree with bright pink-purple flowers growing directly on the bare branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's not spring, go to step 2. If it is spring and no pink flowers, not a California Redbud."
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they shaped exactly like a Valentine's heart with smooth edges (no teeth)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a California Redbud - check trees with different leaf shapes"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Do you see flat, papery pods that are green, reddish-purple, or brown, about 2-4 inches long?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Redbud!"
        no_next: "If it's winter or early spring, check if it has multiple trunks and look for any remaining brown seedpods from last year"

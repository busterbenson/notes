  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A deciduous oak tree with deeply lobed leaves, grayish-white bark, and acorns with shallow cups. It grows in woodland areas, has a broad, rounded crown, and can live for hundreds of years."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Deeply lobed leaves with rounded lobes (never pointed); grayish-white, furrowed bark; acorns with shallow cups"
    secondary_markers: "Rounded, spreading crown on mature trees; leaves clustered at branch ends; bright green leaves that turn golden-brown in fall"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with leaves that look like they have big rounded bites taken out of them, light gray bark, and acorns with shallow cups"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like they've been cut with rounded cookie cutters on both sides"
    touch_tip: "Feel the thick, leathery leaves - they're stiff but not prickly"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently and notice the leaf has very little smell compared to other oaks"
    fun_fact: "Oregon White Oaks can live to be over 500 years old! The acorns were so important to Native Americans that they carefully managed oak woodlands with controlled fires to make sure the trees produced lots of acorns every year."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Do the leaves have deep rounded lobes (like smooth waves) around the edges, never sharp points?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an Oregon White Oak - check other oak species with pointed lobes or trees with different leaf shapes"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark color. Is it light grayish-white with shallow grooves?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a different oak species - check Blue Oak or Valley Oak which have different bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for acorns (in summer and fall). Do they have shallow cups that cover only the bottom quarter of the acorn?"
        yes_next: "You found an Oregon White Oak! Note where it grows - they often grow in grassy woodlands or savannas."
        no_next: "If it's spring with no acorns, check for the pale green leaves with rounded lobes and male catkins hanging down like small worms."

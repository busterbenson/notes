  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A rare evergreen tree with sharp, spine-tipped needles that grow densely around the branches. Most recognizable by its unique cones with long, bristle-like bracts that stick out like spikes or whiskers, giving the tree its common name."

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where you are. Bristlecone Fir only grows wild in the Santa Lucia Mountains of central California coast."
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a wild Bristlecone Fir - they only grow naturally in one small area (though some are planted in gardens)"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully touch a needle (watch out for the sharp tip!). Are the needles stiff with a sharp, spiny point?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Bristlecone Fir - other firs have softer needle tips"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's fall and you can see cones, do they have long spiky bristles sticking out between the scales?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bristlecone Fir!"
        no_next: "If there are no cones, look at the overall shape - Bristlecone Fir is often narrow and columnar"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue developing, long bracts become more noticeable"

      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can start to see the special spiky cones growing bigger"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature with fully developed, protruding bracts"
      identification_tips: "Mature cones with long bracts are highly distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is the best time to see the fully grown cones with their crazy spiky whiskers"

      reproductive_activity: "Cones break apart on the tree, releasing seeds"
      identification_tips: "Look for cone remnants and distinctive growth form"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the cones break apart and drop their seeds, but the tree keeps its sharp green needles"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized tree with bright white bark that peels in horizontal, paper-like sheets. Has diamond-shaped or triangular leaves with tiny teeth along the edges, and dangling catkins in spring that look like fuzzy caterpillars."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bright white bark that peels in horizontal paper-like sheets; diamond-shaped leaves with double-toothed edges"

  # Kid-friendly identification section

    fun_fact: "This tree is like a 'super tree' that scientists made by combining two different kinds of birch trees to make one that grows better in warm places like California!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it bright white and peeling in thin paper-like strips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Murray's Birch - might be a different kind of tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a diamond or triangle with tiny teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a different kind of birch - check the leaf shape again"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree medium-sized (about as tall as a three-story building) with a rounded or oval shape?"
        yes_next: "You found a Murray's Birch!"
        no_next: "Might be another type of white-barked birch - check with an adult"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, white to greenish-white bark and round leaves that shake and shimmer in the slightest breeze. Often grows in groves where all trees are actually connected underground as one organism. Leaves turn bright gold in autumn."
  
  # Identification priority
  # This section helps guide the decision tree by highlighting the most distinctive features
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Round leaves that flutter in light wind; smooth, whitish-green bark with dark scars"
    secondary_markers: "Small, tooth-edged leaves; trees often growing in connected groups; straight trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright golden-yellow fall color; early spring catkins before leaves appear"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Round leaves that 'quake' or shimmer in the slightest breeze"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a tree covered with small, round coins that jingle and sparkle when the wind blows"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth and cool like paper, and the leaves feel like thin plastic discs"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the bark has a faint sweet smell if scratched gently"
    fun_fact: "Quaking Aspens can make entire forests where hundreds or thousands of trees are actually all one connected plant underground â€“ the largest living thing on Earth is an Aspen grove!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth and whitish-green with dark marks that look like eyes?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, peeling, or dark brown, it's probably not a Quaking Aspen"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they round like coins with small teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are long, pointy, or have deep lobes, it's not a Quaking Aspen"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently blow on a leaf or wait for a breeze. Do the leaves flutter and shake even in very light wind?"
        yes_next: "You found a Quaking Aspen!"
        no_next: "If the leaves stay still in light wind, it might be a different poplar or birch"

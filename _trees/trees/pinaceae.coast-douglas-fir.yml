  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall, impressive evergreen tree with flat, soft needles that grow all around the branch. Most easily recognized by its hanging cones with special three-pointed 'mouse tails' or little pitchforks sticking out between the scales."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Hanging cones with unique 'mouse tails' (three-pointed bracts) sticking out between scales; soft, flat needles growing all around the branch"
    secondary_markers: "Pointed buds; reddish-brown bark with deep grooves; triangle shape when young, becoming more open as it gets older"
    seasonal_markers: "Cones ripen in late summer; needles stay on the tree all year"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike true firs, cones hang down (don't stand up) and stay whole (don't break apart on the tree); unlike spruces, has flat, bendy needles that aren't sharp or square-shaped when you look at the end"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Cones with little three-pronged 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales"
    memorable_comparison: "The cones look like they have tiny mouse tails or pitchforks hiding between the scales!"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel soft and flat, not sharp or pokey like spruce trees"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle to smell a sweet, slightly lemony scent"
    fun_fact: "Douglas-fir isn't actually a true fir tree! Scientists gave it the name Pseudotsuga, which means 'false hemlock,' because it doesn't fit perfectly in any tree family."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall shape. Is it a tall evergreen tree with a triangle shape?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Douglas-fir - try another type of evergreen tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they flat, soft, and growing all around the branch (not in bunches)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Douglas-fir - if needles are in bunches, check pine trees; if needles are sharp and stiff, check spruce trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for cones on the ground or hanging from branches. Do they have three-pronged 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales?"
        yes_next: "You found a Douglas-fir!"
        no_next: "If the cones don't have 'mouse tails,' it might be a different evergreen tree - check hemlock or true fir"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears as light green, soft shoots at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow dust; female cones start forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for the difference between fresh light green growth and older darker needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Spring brings bright green new growth at the tips of branches - it looks like the tree is growing green candles!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth turns darker to match older needles; cones get bigger and easier to see"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones keep growing throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Growing cones become more noticeable, starting to show their 'mouse tail' bracts"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you can start to see the growing cones with their little 'mouse tails' peeking out"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older inside needles might turn yellow and fall; cones fully ripen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones open and drop seeds with wings"
      identification_tips: "Look for open cones and fallen seeds with wings below the tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones open and drop seeds that spin like helicopter propellers as they fall"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Needles stay green; empty cones might stay on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree rests; buds form for next year's growth"
      identification_tips: "Empty cones with their 'mouse tails' might stay on through winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Douglas-fir stays green, and you might still spot the special cones with mouse tails"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "True Firs (Abies species)"
      differences: "True firs have cones that stand upright and break apart on the tree; cones don't have the 'mouse tail' bracts; needles tend to be arranged more flatly along branches"
      identification_tip: "If the cones stand upright instead of hanging down, or if they break apart on the tree rather than falling whole, it's likely a true fir"
    
    - species: "Spruce (Picea species)"
      differences: "Spruces have stiff, sharp needles that are square-shaped when you look at the end; cones hang down but don't have 'mouse tails'; branches feel rough where old needles have fallen"
      identification_tip: "If rolling a needle between your fingers feels sharp or square, and the cones don't have 'mouse tails,' it's probably a spruce"
    
    - species: "Hemlock (Tsuga species)"
      differences: "Hemlocks have smaller, flatter needles with tiny stems; smaller cones without 'mouse tails'; the very top of the tree often droops over"
      identification_tip: "If the top of the tree droops over like a shepherd's crook and the needles are tiny and flat, it's probably a hemlock"

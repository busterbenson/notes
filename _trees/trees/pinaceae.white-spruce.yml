  common_name: "White Spruce"
  scientific_name: "Picea glauca"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "White Spruce is a medium to tall evergreen tree with short, stiff, blue-green needles that grow singly (not in bundles) and point outward in all directions around the twig. It has drooping, papery cones and gray to brown bark that forms thin, flaky scales."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-green needles pointing in all directions around the twig; square-shaped needles that roll easily between fingers; papery, drooping cones"
    secondary_markers: "Gray to brown thin, flaky bark; cone scales with smooth, rounded edges (not jagged); needles have a skunk-like smell when crushed"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change; stays green year-round; small purple-red female cones appear in spring, mature to light brown by fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Engelmann Spruce, White Spruce needles have a stronger skunk-like smell when crushed; unlike Sitka Spruce, White Spruce needles are more blue-green and cones have smoother edges; unlike Norway Spruce, White Spruce has shorter cones and branches don't droop as dramatically"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Pointy blue-green needles that grow all around the twig and roll between your fingers"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like tiny swords sticking out in all directions, and they feel square when you roll them"
    touch_tip: "Gently roll a needle between your fingers - it should roll easily because it's square shaped!"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a needle and take a quick sniff - it has a strong smell like a skunk or cat pee!"
    fun_fact: "White Spruce is super tough! It can survive in places that are freezing cold for most of the year. Some White Spruce trees can live for over 300 years - that's older than the United States!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check how the needles grow. Do they stick out all around the twig like tiny swords pointing in every direction?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a White Spruce - if needles are flat and spread out in two rows, check other evergreens"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently roll a needle between your fingers. Does it roll easily because it has four sides (square shaped)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a White Spruce - if needles are flat and don't roll easily, check firs or hemlocks"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Carefully crush a needle and take a quick sniff. Does it have a strong, stinky smell (like a skunk or cat pee)?"
        yes_next: "You found a White Spruce!"
        no_next: "Might be another spruce species - check the cones"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears, often brighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small purple-red female cones form at branch tips; yellow pollen is released from male cones"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright new growth at branch tips and small colorful cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the bright green new needle growth and tiny purple-red baby cones at the tips of branches"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to blue-green color; cones grow larger and turn from purple-red to green"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue developing, changing from purple-red to green as they grow"
      identification_tips: "Developing green cones make identification easier"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the tiny cones grow bigger and change from purple-red to green, like they're ripening"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles yellow and drop; cones mature and open"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones turn brown, open to release seeds, which are carried by small wings"
      identification_tips: "Open, light brown cones hanging from branches are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown and open up to let their seeds fly away with tiny wings attached"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree remains green; empty opened cones may stay on the tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Blue-green needle color often stands out against snow"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, White Spruce stays green when other trees lose their leaves, and its blue-green color looks pretty against the snow"

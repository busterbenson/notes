  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized pine tree that grows mainly along the California coast. It has pairs of twisted needles and knobby cones that often stay closed for many years."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles grow in bundles of two; cones often remain closed and attached to branches for many years"
    secondary_markers: "Cones have knobby protrusions on the scales; trees often grow in coastal areas or poor soils"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears lighter green"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Monterey Pine, has smaller, knobby cones; unlike Knobcone Pine, has needles in pairs rather than threes"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with needles in pairs and bumpy cones that stay on the tree for years"
    memorable_comparison: "The cones look like little pineapples with knobby bumps that stay stuck to the branches"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the needles - they come in pairs and are slightly twisted, like friends holding hands while dancing"
    smell_tip: "Carefully sniff the needles for a fresh pine scent (don't crush or break them)"
    fun_fact: "Bishop Pine's cones are super patient - they can stay closed and attached to the tree for 20 years or more, waiting for a fire to open them up and release their seeds! It's like they're saving their seeds in a piggy bank until just the right moment."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Do they grow in bundles of 2 (just two needles connected at the base)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Bishop Pine - if there are 3 needles per bundle, check Knobcone Pine or other 3-needle pines"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the cones on the tree or ground. Are they about the size of a chicken egg with bumpy knobs on the scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Bishop Pine - check Monterey Pine which has larger, smoother cones"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are you near the coast, and do the cones stay attached to the branches for many years?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bishop Pine!"
        no_next: "Not sure? Check if the tree grows in poor soil or foggy areas - Bishop Pines like these tough spots"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears, often with a lighter green color; male pollen cones produce yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth at branch tips and yellow pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for lighter green new 'candles' growing at the tips of branches"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to darker green; small developing cones visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones continue to develop but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "New cones are green to purple, becoming woody by late summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and small green or purple baby cones start to form"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature but typically remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Older needles may drop, creating a layer of needle litter beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is quiet time for Bishop Pine - it stays green while other trees change color"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen form stands out against deciduous trees; cone pattern distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its green needles when other trees lose their leaves"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A large, fast-growing deciduous tree with distinctive four-lobed leaves that resemble a tulip outline. It produces showy yellow-green flowers that look like tulips, and develops a tall, straight trunk with gray, furrowed bark. Also known as Tulip Poplar or Yellow Poplar, though not actually related to poplars."

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tall tree with unique leaves shaped like an outline of a tulip flower (or a cat's face with flat ears) and yellow-green flowers that look like tulips"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like someone drew the outline of a tulip flower, then colored it in green, or like a cat face with the ears cut flat instead of pointed!"
    touch_tip: "The leaves are smooth and feel like paper. They move and flutter in the breeze."
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the flowers have a faint sweet scent if you can reach them."
    fun_fact: "Even though it's called a Tulip 'Poplar' or 'Yellow Poplar,' this tree isn't related to poplars at all! It's actually a member of the magnolia family. Its flowers look like tulips, which is how it got its name, and it's one of the tallest hardwood trees in America!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves (in spring through fall). Do they have a unique shape with four lobes and a flat or notched top, looking a bit like a cat face with flat ears?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Tulip Tree - no other tree in California has leaves shaped like this"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Is it a large tree with a straight, tall trunk and gray bark that gets furrowed with age?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a mature Tulip Tree or could be something else"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In late spring, does it have large yellow-green flowers shaped like tulips (though they might be high up and hard to see on tall trees)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Tulip Tree!"
        no_next: "If it's not flowering season, check for the distinctive leaf shape and tall, straight growth"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In fall, do the leaves turn a clear yellow color before falling?"
        yes_next: "This confirms it's likely a Tulip Tree"
        no_next: "If the fall color is different, double-check the leaf shape"

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Foliage turns bright clear yellow; seed clusters mature and begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and begin to disperse by wind"
      identification_tips: "Bright yellow fall color and distinctive leaf shape"

  # Look-alike species
  look_alikes:

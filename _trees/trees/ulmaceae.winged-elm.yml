  # Basic summary
  summary: "The Winged Elm is a medium-sized deciduous tree known for its distinctive corky, wing-like growths on the branches. It has small, oval leaves with double-toothed edges, produces tiny flowers in spring, and has a graceful vase-like shape when mature."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Corky, wing-like growths along branches; leaves are small (1-3 inches), oval-shaped with a rough upper surface and double-toothed edges"
    secondary_markers: "Vase-shaped crown in mature trees; light to medium gray bark with shallow furrows; small, flat, circular winged seeds"
    seasonal_markers: "Tiny reddish-brown flowers in early spring before leaves appear; seeds mature and drop in spring; leaves turn yellow in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American Elm, has smaller leaves and distinct corky wings on branches; unlike Cedar Elm, has larger leaves and fewer teeth; unlike Slippery Elm, leaves are smaller and rough on top but not sandpaper-like below"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Corky 'wings' growing along the branches"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like they have little fins or wings growing on them, like a dragon's back"
    touch_tip: "Run your finger along a younger branch to feel the woody ridges that make the 'wings'"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they feel a bit scratchy if you touch them"
    fun_fact: "The wings on this tree's branches help it survive in dry periods by storing water, like a camel's hump stores water in the desert!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the branches. Do they have thin, corky ridges that look like wings running along the sides?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Winged Elm - check other elm species or trees with similar leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they small (1-3 inches), oval-shaped with double-toothed edges (like teeth on top of teeth)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Winged Elm - check other trees with winged branches"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the overall shape of the tree. Does it have a vase-like shape, wider at the top than bottom?"
        yes_next: "You found a Winged Elm!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Winged Elm, especially if it's young or growing in a crowded area"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree famous for its stunning cloud-like display of purple-blue flowers in late spring. It has delicate, fern-like leaves divided into many small leaflets, and a spreading, umbrella-shaped crown. After flowering, it produces flat, woody seed pods that look like large brown discs."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Showy clusters of purple-blue trumpet-shaped flowers covering the tree in late spring; fern-like feathery leaves"
    secondary_markers: "Gray bark with distinctive diamond-pattern cracks; flat, round, woody seed pods; umbrella-shaped crown"
    seasonal_markers: "Covered in purple-blue flowers in late spring; seed pods visible in summer and fall; may temporarily lose leaves in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "No other common landscape trees have the combination of purple-blue flowers and fern-like compound leaves; purple flowers are much bluer than similar-colored Eastern Redbuds"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Purple-blue flowers that cover the whole tree like a purple cloud, with leaves that look like ferns"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's covered in purple butterflies when in bloom, and its leaves look like green feathers"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel light and feathery; each big leaf is made up of many tiny leaflets"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell, but you might need to pick up a fallen flower to smell it"
    fun_fact: "Jacaranda flowers can cover the ground with a purple carpet! In some places, people say that if a Jacaranda flower falls on your head while you're studying, you'll pass your test!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the whole tree shape. Does it have a wide, umbrella-like crown with feathery-looking leaves?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Jacaranda - look for trees with different leaf types or shapes"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check if the leaves are very feathery, like ferns, divided into many small leaflets"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Jacaranda - try trees with compound feathery leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In late spring, does it have masses of purple-blue flowers covering the branches?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's not flowering season, look for flat, round seed pods or check the leaf arrangement (pairs facing each other)"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Are the flowers trumpet-shaped with five petals, and purple-blue in color?"
        yes_next: "You found a Jacaranda!"
        no_next: "Not a Jacaranda - check the flower shape and color again"

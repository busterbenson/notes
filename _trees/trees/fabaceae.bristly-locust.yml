  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small tree or large shrub with compound leaves, showy clusters of pink to rose-purple flowers, and distinctive reddish-brown bristly hairs covering the stems and seed pods. Unlike Black Locust, it rarely grows taller than 10 feet and is notable for its fuzzy stems rather than sharp thorns."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with oval leaflets arranged along a stem; stems and seed pods covered with reddish-brown bristly hairs; showy pink to rose-purple flowers in hanging clusters"
    secondary_markers: "Typically small, often growing as a multi-stemmed shrub; seed pods covered with bristles; lacks the prominent thorns of other locusts"
    seasonal_markers: "Beautiful pink flower clusters in late spring; brown bristly seed pods in summer and fall; yellow fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Black Locust, has pink (not white) flowers and bristly hairs instead of thorns; unlike New Mexico Locust, has bristly stems and stays smaller"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree or shrub with pretty pink flowers and stems covered in reddish-brown fuzzy bristles that look like tiny hairs"
    memorable_comparison: "The stems look like they're covered in reddish-brown pipe cleaners or fuzzy caterpillars"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the bristly hairs on the stems - they're fuzzy but not as sharp as real thorns"
    smell_tip: "When it's blooming, smell the sweet fragrance of the pink flower clusters"
    fun_fact: "Even though it's called 'Bristly Locust,' this plant is more like a big shrub than a tree, and those bristles are its way of saying 'please don't eat me' to hungry animals!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the size. Is it small (shorter than a one-story house) and often growing with multiple stems like a big shrub?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's tall with a single trunk, it's probably a different locust species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the stems and branches. Are they covered with reddish-brown bristly hairs that look fuzzy?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it has sharp thorns instead of bristles, it might be Black Locust or another locust species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "When it's flowering, are the flowers pink to purple (not white)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the flowers are white, it's probably Black Locust"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they made up of small oval leaflets arranged along a central stem?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bristly Locust!"
        no_next: "If the leaves are different, it might be another shrub with pink flowers"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia)"

      identification_tip: "If it has white flowers and sharp thorns instead of bristles, it's Black Locust, not Bristly Locust"
    - species: "New Mexico Locust (Robinia neomexicana)"
      differences: "New Mexico Locust grows taller (15-25 feet); has paired thorns; has pink flowers but less bristly stems and pods"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small, drought-loving deciduous tree with long, thin willow-like leaves and beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Despite its name, it's not a true willow but belongs to the same family as catalpa and jacaranda. Native to desert washes in southwestern United States."

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Long, skinny leaves like a willow tree, but with pretty pink trumpet flowers that grow in dry places"
    memorable_comparison: "The flowers look like little pink trumpets or orchids, and the tree is tough enough to live in the desert!"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly rough and papery; the bark feels flaky and peels off in strips"
    smell_tip: "Some people think the flowers smell sweet, like honey or vanilla (but not everyone can smell it)"
    fun_fact: "Desert Willow isn't a true willow at all! It's named 'Desert Willow' because it has long skinny leaves like a willow tree, but it's actually related to trumpet vines and jacaranda trees."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, notice where the tree is growing. Is it in a dry, sunny place, not near water?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's growing near water, it might be a true willow, not a Desert Willow"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they long, narrow, and willow-like, but growing on somewhat twisted branches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Desert Willow - try looking at trees with similar leaf shapes"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check for flowers or seed pods. Do you see trumpet-shaped pink or purple flowers, or long skinny seed pods?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's not flowering season, look for long bean-like seed pods or check the tree's overall size (usually smaller than true willows)"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the trunk and bark. Is the trunk often twisted with gray-brown peeling bark?"
        yes_next: "You found a Desert Willow!"
        no_next: "Maybe a different type of flowering tree - check a tree guidebook"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "True Willows (Salix species)"
      differences: "True willows grow near water, not in dry areas; have catkins instead of showy flowers; more flexible branches"
      identification_tip: "If it's growing near water and has fuzzy catkins instead of trumpet flowers, it's a true willow"

      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow before dropping"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pods mature and begin to dry out; may still have some late flowers"
      identification_tips: "Long seed pods become more visible as leaves drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow and fall off, and you can see lots of long, skinny seed pods that look like green beans"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leafless with twisted, gnarly branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dry seed pods often remain on branches"

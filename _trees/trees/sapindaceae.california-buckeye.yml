  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with 5-7 leaflets all spreading from one point, like fingers on a hand"
    memorable_comparison: "Its flower clusters look like white candles standing up all over the tree in spring, and its seeds look like smooth brown chestnuts"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth, leathery leaves and, in fall, the super smooth, shiny brown seeds that look like polished wood"
    smell_tip: "In spring, carefully smell the sweet fragrance of the white flower clusters (but don't touch the flowers to your face)"
    fun_fact: "California Buckeye is a time traveler among trees! It wakes up super early in spring with bright green leaves, then goes to sleep early by dropping its leaves in summer when it's hot and dry - while other trees are still wide awake with green leaves. The big shiny seeds were carried by Native American kids as lucky charms, and they feel cool and smooth in your pocket!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have 5-7 leaflets all spreading out from one point like fingers on a hand?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a California Buckeye - check trees with different leaf patterns"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "In spring, does it have tall clusters of white flowers standing up like candles? Or in summer, is it already dropping its leaves when other trees are still green?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a California Buckeye - check for other trees with hand-like leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In late summer or fall, does it have large, pear-shaped pods with big, shiny brown seeds inside that look like chestnuts?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Buckeye!"
        no_next: "If it has different fruits or no fruits visible, check the bark - California Buckeye has fairly smooth gray bark"

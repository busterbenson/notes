  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A beautiful high-elevation evergreen tree with a distinctive drooping leader (top), bluish-green needles that grow all around the twig (not just on two sides), and small oval cones. It thrives in deep snow and is often bent or twisted by snow loads."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Drooping leader (top of tree); needles growing all around twig rather than in flat sprays; bluish-green foliage"
    secondary_markers: "Small oval cones about 1-3 inches long; thin, scaly, purplish-gray bark; graceful branching pattern"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as lighter green at branch tips"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Western Hemlock, has needles growing all around twigs (not in flat sprays); unlike Subalpine Fir, has drooping leader and hanging cones; unlike Engelmann Spruce, has more flexible, less sharp needles"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with a droopy top that looks like it's nodding, bluish-green needles growing all around the twigs, and small hanging cones"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a Christmas tree that's sleepy and nodding its head, with soft blue-green needles and tiny pinecones hanging like ornaments"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel soft and slightly curved, not pokey like spruce - you can gently run your finger along a branch"
    smell_tip: "Carefully smell the needles for a fresh, clean mountain scent (don't crush them)"
    fun_fact: "Mountain Hemlocks are snow champions! They live where snow can pile up 20 feet deep in winter. Their flexible branches bend instead of breaking under heavy snow, and their narrow, droopy shape helps snow slide off instead of weighing them down. Some Mountain Hemlocks can survive being buried in snow for 8 months of the year!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the top of the tree. Does it droop downward instead of pointing straight up?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Mountain Hemlock - check if it might be a fir or spruce with a straight-up top"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the needles. Do they stick out all around the twig (like bottle brushes) rather than forming flat sprays?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be Western Hemlock, which has needles in flat, feathery sprays"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the needles soft, bluish-green, and growing in high mountains where there's lots of snow in winter?"
        yes_next: "You found a Mountain Hemlock!"
        no_next: "If the needles are sharp and prickly, check Engelmann Spruce; if you're at lower elevations, it might be another conifer"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears lighter green at branch tips; snow gradually melts away"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "New growth stands out as bright green against older bluish-green needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green baby needles at the tips of branches as the snow melts away"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older foliage; young cones are visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow larger and begin to mature"
      identification_tips: "Young purplish cones visible on branches; drooping leader distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see small purple-brown cones hanging from the branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; preparations for winter dormancy"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and release seeds with winged attachments"
      identification_tips: "Mature brown cones may open to release seeds before winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the small cones open up to let their seeds fly away on tiny wings before the snow comes"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Often partially or completely buried in deep snow"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Graceful form with snow load; branches bend but rarely break"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, these trees might be completely buried in snow, with only their tops sticking out!"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)"
      differences: "Western Hemlock has needles arranged in flat sprays, grows at lower elevations, and has a greener color"
      identification_tip: "Mountain Hemlock needles stick out all around the twig, while Western Hemlock needles form flat, feathery sprays"
    - species: "Subalpine Fir (Abies lasiocarpa)"
      differences: "Subalpine Fir has an upright, spire-like top (not drooping) and upright cones that disintegrate on the tree"
      identification_tip: "If the top points straight up like a spire and you see upright cones, it's likely Subalpine Fir, not Mountain Hemlock"
    - species: "Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii)"
      differences: "Engelmann Spruce has stiff, sharp needles that are square in cross-section and a straight top"
      identification_tip: "Gently touch the needles - Mountain Hemlock needles are softer and flatter, while Spruce needles are sharp and pokey"

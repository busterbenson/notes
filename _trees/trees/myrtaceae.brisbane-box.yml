  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Reddish-brown bark that peels in puzzle-like pieces, with shiny dark green leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like it's playing dress-up, peeling off old layers to show new reddish skin underneath"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel thick and leathery, like plastic plant leaves; the bark feels spongy when newly exposed"
    smell_tip: "Unlike eucalyptus trees (which it looks similar to), the leaves don't have a strong smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "This tree is related to eucalyptus trees that koalas eat, but it's actually in the same family as cloves, allspice, and guava! It's called 'Brisbane Box' because it comes from Brisbane, Australia, and early settlers used its wood to make boxes."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling in puzzle-piece patches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Brisbane Box - try trees with different bark patterns"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they shiny, dark green, and grouped near the ends of branches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Brisbane Box - check for trees with different leaf arrangements"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Does the tree have a dense, rounded crown that provides good shade?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might not be a Brisbane Box - check for trees with different shapes"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Crush a leaf gently and smell it. Does it have no strong smell (unlike eucalyptus which smells strong)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Brisbane Box!"
        no_next: "If it has a strong eucalyptus smell, it's probably a eucalyptus tree, not a Brisbane Box"

      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no flowering activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature stands out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it's easy to spot because it keeps all its leaves when many other trees are bare"

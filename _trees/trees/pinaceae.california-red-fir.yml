  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A beautiful, perfectly shaped evergreen tree with a pointed top and bluish-green needles that curve upward around the branch. Has reddish-brown bark that gets thick and chunky as it grows older and large, upright barrel-shaped cones (as big as a soda can) that break apart while still on the tree."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Thick, upward-curving bluish-green needles arranged like bottle brushes around branches; large upright barrel-shaped cones"
    secondary_markers: "Perfect triangle tree shape with pointed top; reddish-brown chunky bark on older trees"
    seasonal_markers: "Cones break apart on the tree in late summer/fall, leaving the middle spike"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike White Fir, has needles that curve upward more strongly around branches; unlike Douglas-fir, has upright cones that break apart on the tree instead of falling whole"

    fun_fact: "California Red Fir cones don't fall off the tree whole! Instead, they stand up like candles and then break apart into hundreds of scales that float down separately, leaving just a spike on the branch."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall shape. Is it a tall, perfect Christmas tree shape with a pointed top?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a California Red Fir - try another evergreen tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Do they curve upward around the branch like they're giving the branch a hug?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a California Red Fir - if needles are in bunches, check pine trees; if needles are flat along the branch, check other fir trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for cones at the top of the tree or on the ground. Do the cones stand straight up on the branches (not hang down)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a California Red Fir - if cones hang down, check Douglas-fir or spruce"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the bark on an older tree. Is it reddish-brown with thick, chunky pieces?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Red Fir!"
        no_next: "If the bark isn't reddish, it might be White Fir or another fir tree"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New light green growth appears at branch tips; buds swell and open"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow dust; female cones start forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright light green new growth against older blue-green needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new needle growth at the branch tips - like little green candles!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth turns darker to match older needles; cones get bigger at the top of tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones keep growing and become easier to see"
      identification_tips: "Fully formed upright cones (as big as soda cans) become visible on upper branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you can spot the big upright cones near the top of the tree - they look like candles on a cake!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Needles stay mostly the same color; cones turn brown and start breaking apart"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones break apart on the tree, dropping seeds and scales but leaving the middle spike"
      identification_tips: "Look for cone pieces scattered on the ground beneath the tree; spiky centers stay on branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones break apart like pinecone explosions, scattering scales and seeds everywhere!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Needles stay blue-green; cone spikes might stay on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree rests; buds might start forming for next year"
      identification_tips: "Triangle shape and blue-green needles stand out against snow"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter snow, Red Fir keeps its blue-green color and perfect Christmas tree shape"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "White Fir (Abies concolor)"
      differences: "White Fir has flatter needles that don't curve up as much; usually has smaller cones (3-5 inches); needles look more silvery-blue"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are flatter along the branch rather than curving strongly upward, and the cones are smaller, it's likely White Fir"
    
    - species: "Noble Fir (Abies procera)"
      differences: "Noble Fir has more tightly packed, blue needles that curve upward even more; cones have little 'wings' sticking out between scales"
      identification_tip: "If the cone has little 'wings' sticking out between the scales, it's a Noble Fir, not Red Fir"
    
    - species: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      differences: "Douglas-fir has hanging (not upright) cones with 'mouse tails' sticking out; cones fall off whole rather than breaking apart; bark has deep grooves rather than chunky pieces"
      identification_tip: "If the cones hang down instead of standing upright, it's not a true fir tree at all"

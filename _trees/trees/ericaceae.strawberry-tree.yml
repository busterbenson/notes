  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Peeling reddish-brown bark; distinctive red-orange round fruits that look like strawberries or tiny oranges"
    secondary_markers: "Bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers; leathery dark green leaves with serrated edges; fruits and flowers often present simultaneously"
    seasonal_markers: "White flowers in fall and winter; bright red-orange fruits mature in fall but can persist through winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Pacific Madrone, has smaller leaves and fruits; unlike manzanitas, grows taller and has distinctly strawberry-like fruits instead of small berries"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Red-orange fruits that look just like strawberries or small bumpy oranges"
    memorable_comparison: "A tree that grows strawberries on its branches instead of on the ground!"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - it's peeling and papery like sunburned skin, and the color is like cinnamon"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently and smell a light, pleasant scent like tea leaves"
    fun_fact: "This tree is nicknamed the 'unedo' because ancient Romans said 'unum edo' meaning 'I eat only one' - the fruits look better than they taste!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look for peeling reddish-brown bark that looks like cinnamon. Can you see bark peeling in thin layers?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Strawberry Tree - look for trees with peeling cinnamon-colored bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they dark green, shiny, and leathery with toothed edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Strawberry Tree - check for evergreen trees with leathery dark green leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for round, bumpy red or orange fruits that look like strawberries, especially in fall and winter. Do you see any?"
        yes_next: "You found a Strawberry Tree!"
        no_next: 4
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small, hanging white bell-shaped flowers, especially in fall. Do you see these?"
        yes_next: "You found a Strawberry Tree - the fruits will come later!"
        no_next: "It might be a Strawberry Tree, but come back in fall to check for flowers or fruits"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Pacific Madrone (Arbutus menziesii)"
      differences: "Native to California; grows much larger; has bigger leaves and larger, smoother orange-red fruits"
      identification_tip: "If it's a tall tree with very large leaves and bigger, smoother fruits, it's likely a Pacific Madrone"
    - species: "Manzanita (Arctostaphylos species)"
      differences: "Usually shrub-sized; smaller, rounder leaves; smaller, smoother berries; more twisted growth habit"
      identification_tip: "If it's shorter with very twisty branches and small round berries, it's probably a manzanita"
    - species: "Chinese Photinia (Photinia serratifolia)"
      differences: "Has similar leaves but lacks the peeling bark; produces small dark berries, not strawberry-like fruits"
      identification_tip: "If the bark doesn't peel and the fruits are small dark berries, it's likely a photinia"
      
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaf growth appears, slightly lighter green than older leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Previous year's fruits may still be present; flowers have fallen"
      identification_tips: "Peeling bark and evergreen nature easiest to observe"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the cinnamon-colored peeling bark and shiny green leaves - some old fruits might still be on the tree"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full, dark green mature foliage; previous fruits have fallen or been eaten"
      reproductive_activity: "Developing flower buds may be visible late in summer"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive bark and leaf characteristics best for summer identification"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the tree rests from making fruits and flowers and focuses on growing its shiny green leaves"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "New flowers appear in clusters; fruits begin to develop and turn from green to yellow to orange to red"
      reproductive_activity: "Main flowering period; early fruit development"
      identification_tips: "Flowers and developing fruits often present simultaneously - a key identifier"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is the most exciting time - the tree makes white bell-shaped flowers AND starts growing new strawberry-like fruits at the same time!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; mature red fruits often present; some flowers may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruits fully mature; late flowers may still appear"
      identification_tips: "Red fruits against dark green leaves are most distinctive winter feature"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the bright red strawberry-like fruits really stand out against the dark green leaves, making the tree easy to find"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Do they look like tiny scales forming flat, fan-like sprays?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the tree has needles instead of scales, it's not an Atlantic White-cedar"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the color of the leaf sprays. Are they blue-green, almost with a silverish tint?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If they're bright green or yellowish-green, it might be a different cedar relative"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Very carefully crush a tiny bit of the foliage between your fingers and smell. Is there a strong cedar scent?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If there's no smell or a different smell, it might be another conifer"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for tiny round cones about the size of a pea. Can you spot any on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found an Atlantic White-cedar!"
        no_next: "If no cones are visible, check the bark - on older trees it should be reddish and slightly shreddy"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A stately deciduous tree with distinctive smooth, light gray bark that remains smooth even in old age. Features simple, elliptical leaves with prominent straight veins and toothed edges that turn golden bronze in fall. Native to eastern North America but occasionally planted as an ornamental in parks and large gardens in California."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Smooth, light gray bark that remains smooth even on large, old trees; elliptical leaves with straight, parallel veins extending to sharp teeth on leaf edge; slender, pointed cigar-shaped buds in winter"
    secondary_markers: "Triangular, spiky husks containing small three-sided nuts; thin, paper-like leaves with finely toothed edges; golden bronze fall color"
    seasonal_markers: "Delicate spring green leaves in spring; dense dark green summer foliage; golden bronze fall color; smooth gray bark visible year-round with zigzag twigs and long pointed buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike European beech, has slightly larger leaves with more pronounced teeth; unlike hornbeam, bark remains smooth throughout life and never becomes fluted or muscled; unlike birches, does not have peeling bark"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, elephant-skin gray bark that stays smooth even on big trees, and leaves with straight lines running to tiny teeth"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like elephant skin - smooth and gray - and the leaves are shaped like pointy footballs with little teeth and straight lines that look like train tracks heading to each tooth"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel papery and thin, and the smooth bark feels cool to the touch, like touching a gray elephant"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a light fresh smell, especially when they first come out in spring"
    fun_fact: "The bark of beech trees is so smooth and inviting that people have been carving their names and messages into beech trees for hundreds of years! Some old beech trees in forests back east are like nature's history books, with carvings from over 100 years ago still visible on the bark."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth and gray, even on big trees, without any cracks or peeling?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, furrowed, or peeling, it's not a beech tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they oval or football-shaped with straight, parallel lines (veins) running from the middle to small teeth at the edge?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have a different shape or don't have straight veins running to teeth, it might be another tree with smooth bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In winter, check the buds - are they long, pointed, and cigar-shaped (about 3/4 inch long)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's not winter or the buds are short and round, check if the tree is growing in a park or garden setting, not a wild forest"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree growing in a park, large garden, or landscape setting (not a wild forest in California)?"
        yes_next: "You found an American Beech!"
        no_next: "Beech trees are not native to California, so they're usually only found where people have planted them"
  
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Buds open to reveal delicate, light green leaves with silky hairs along the edges when young; subtle male catkins may be visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers appear with the leaves; inconspicuous male and female flowers on the same tree"
      identification_tips: "Look for the emerging leaves with straight veins and the distinctive smooth gray bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, beech trees have bright light green leaves that look almost translucent, like they're lit up from inside"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves mature to a darker green with a glossy surface; dense canopy creates deep shade beneath"

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn golden bronze to yellow before falling; open spiny husks may release triangular nuts"
      reproductive_activity: "Nuts mature and fall from open husks"
      identification_tips: "Golden bronze fall color; spiny husks with triangular nuts; smooth gray bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn a beautiful golden color like honey or toast, and you might find spiky seed cases that look like tiny hedgehogs with triangular nuts inside"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Smooth gray bark stands out in winter landscape; zigzag twigs with long, pointed cigar-shaped buds; young trees often retain dead leaves"

  common_name: "Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
  scientific_name: "Frangula betulifolia"
  family: "Rhamnaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "A small deciduous tree or large shrub with birch-like oval leaves that have prominent parallel veins. It produces small star-shaped flowers that develop into red berries that turn black when ripe. The smooth gray bark and alternating leaves help identify this drought-tolerant species."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Oval to round birch-like leaves with prominent parallel veins; small red berries that turn black when ripe"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark; alternating leaf arrangement; small star-shaped yellowish-green flowers; grows in dry washes and canyons"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow fall color; red to black berries in summer and fall; small yellowish-green flowers in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike true buckthorns, lacks thorns; unlike birch trees, has alternate (not opposite) leaves and lacks the peeling bark; unlike cascara, leaves are more rounded and typically smaller"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Round leaves with parallel lines (veins) that look like they're drawn with a ruler, and berries that change from red to black like tiny cherries"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like little green pancakes with lines drawn on them, and the berries look like miniature cherries that change color"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf surface - it's slightly leathery but not stiff, and the lines (veins) are raised so you can feel them with your finger"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but if you gently crush one, you might notice a mild, earthy scent"
    fun_fact: "This plant has special berries that change color as they grow up - from green to red to black - like they're getting a new outfit each time! Birds love to eat them and spread the seeds in their poop, planting new trees wherever they go."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the size - is it a small tree or large shrub (not taller than your house)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's a tall tree, it's not a Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they oval to round with parallel lines (veins) running from the middle line to the edge?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have a different pattern or shape, it's probably not a Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check if the leaves alternate on the stem (not directly across from each other). Do they grow in an alternating pattern?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If leaves grow directly opposite each other, it's not a Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In summer or fall, look for small berries that may be red or black. Can you see any berries on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Birchleaf False-buckthorn!"
        no_next: "If it's the right season and there are no berries, check the bark - is it smooth and gray? If yes, it might still be a Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge light green; small yellowish-green star-shaped flowers appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom, attracting small pollinators like bees and flies"
      identification_tips: "Look for the small star-shaped flowers and the distinctive parallel veins on new leaves"

      visual_changes: "Full canopy of deep green leaves; berries form and begin to turn from green to red"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers develop into berries that gradually ripen"
      identification_tips: "Red berries and the fully developed leaves with parallel veins are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer brings small red berries that look like tiny cherries - but don't eat them! They're for birds"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow; berries ripen to black"
      reproductive_activity: "Berries fully ripen and are eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds"
      identification_tips: "Black berries and yellow leaves with their distinctive parallel veins"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the berries turn black like little beads, and the leaves turn yellow before falling off"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Loses all leaves; smooth gray branches visible; sometimes a few dried berries may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Cascara (Frangula purshiana)"
      differences: "Cascara grows larger (up to 30 feet); has more elongated, less round leaves; typically found in moister habitats"
      identification_tip: "If it's a larger tree with more elongated leaves in a moist forest setting, it's likely Cascara rather than Birchleaf False-buckthorn"
    
    - species: "Alder-leaf Buckthorn (Rhamnus alnifolia)"
      differences: "Alder-leaf Buckthorn has opposite leaves (not alternate); typically has thorns; more shrubby in form"

    - species: "Western River Birch (Betula occidentalis)"
      differences: "River Birch has peeling or flaking bark; more serrated leaf edges; typically grows near permanent water sources"
      identification_tip: "If the bark peels or flakes and the tree grows near year-round water, it's likely a birch, not False-buckthorn"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A large deciduous tree closely related to Sugar Maple, with dark green leaves that have three to five lobes and drooping sides. It has dark gray to almost black bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age, and produces the familiar paired helicopter seeds in fall."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark green leaves with 3-5 shallow lobes and drooping sides; paired winged seeds (helicopters); dark gray to blackish bark with age"
    secondary_markers: "Leaves grow opposite each other on branches; leaf undersides are somewhat hairy; leaf edges with rounded rather than pointed teeth"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow to orange-red fall color; bright green yellow flowers in spring hanging in clusters; winged seeds mature in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Sugar Maple, has droopier leaf edges and hairier leaf undersides; unlike Norway Maple, no milky sap when leaf stem is broken"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Dark green maple leaves that droop at the sides like they're tired, with dark bark that can look almost black on older trees"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like they've been out in the hot sun too long and are drooping, while Sugar Maple leaves stand more upright"
    touch_tip: "Feel the underside of a leaf - it has fine fuzzy hairs that Sugar Maple doesn't have"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to release a mild maple scent, especially in spring and summer"
    fun_fact: "Black Maple sap can be made into maple syrup just like Sugar Maple! Native Americans and early settlers would tap these trees in early spring to collect the sweet sap, then boil it down to make syrup. It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make just 1 gallon of maple syrup!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at how the leaves grow on branches. Do they grow in pairs, directly across from each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Black Maple - if leaves alternate along the branch, check other tree types"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Do they have 3-5 lobes and sides that droop downward rather than sticking out?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaf has more pointed lobes that stick outward, it might be Sugar Maple or another maple species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Feel the underside of a leaf. Is it somewhat fuzzy or hairy?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If leaf undersides are smooth, it's more likely Sugar Maple than Black Maple"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the tree bark. On older trees, is it dark gray to almost black and deeply grooved?"
        yes_next: "You found a Black Maple!"
        no_next: "If the bark is lighter gray, it might be a Sugar Maple, which is very similar to Black Maple"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge light green; small yellow-green flower clusters appear before or with new leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom and are pollinated by wind and insects"
      identification_tips: "Look for drooping leaf edges and fuzzy undersides on new leaves; yellow-green flower clusters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, tiny yellowish-green flowers hang like little bells before the leaves fully grow"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves mature to dark green with drooping sides; winged seed pairs develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds continue to develop throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Dark green drooping leaves with fuzzy undersides; paired developing helicopters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the big dark green leaves look tired and droopy, especially on hot days"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to sometimes orange or red; winged seeds mature and fall, spinning as they descend"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and drop from tree, spinning like helicopters"
      identification_tips: "Fall color plus mature seeds; leaf shape and drooping sides still visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall brings golden yellow leaves and lots of helicopter seeds spinning down"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree loses all leaves; paired buds on opposite twigs; dark bark more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Dark bark, opposite branching pattern, and paired buds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the dark bark and twigs with buds that grow in pairs across from each other"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum)"
      differences: "Very similar, but Sugar Maple has more deeply cut leaf lobes, smoother leaf undersides, and leaf edges that don't droop as much"
      identification_tip: "Feel the leaf underside - Black Maple is fuzzy, while Sugar Maple is mostly smooth"
    
    - species: "Norway Maple (Acer platanoides)"
      differences: "Norway Maple has more pointed leaf lobes, milky white sap when leaf stem is broken, and usually broader, less droopy leaves"
      identification_tip: "Break a leaf stem - if it oozes milky white sap, it's probably Norway Maple, not Black Maple"
    
    - species: "Red Maple (Acer rubrum)"
      differences: "Red Maple usually has more sharply toothed leaf edges, redder twigs and buds, and often earlier fall color"
      identification_tip: "Red Maple leaves usually have more pointed teeth and lobes than the rounded ones of Black Maple"

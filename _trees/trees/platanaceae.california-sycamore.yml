  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Mottled, peeling bark with patches of white, tan, and brown; large maple-like leaves with 3-5 lobes"
    secondary_markers: "Round, spiky seed balls that hang from branches; broad, spreading crown; often grows near water"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright green leaves in spring, yellowing in fall; bare branches with hanging seed balls in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike London Plane Tree, has larger leaves and more irregular branching; unlike maples, has multiple round seed balls instead of winged seeds"

        no_next: "Not a California Sycamore - try looking at maple or oak trees"
      - step: 2

        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a California Sycamore - check if it's a London Plane Tree with smaller leaves"

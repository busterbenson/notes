  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized evergreen conifer native to the southern Appalachian Mountains with a narrow, pyramidal crown.

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Short, flat, dark green needles with white bands underneath; narrow pyramidal shape; smooth gray bark with resin blisters"
    secondary_markers: "Upright purplish-green to brown cones; needles appear to be arranged in two rows; pleasant balsam fragrance when needles are crushed"
    seasonal_markers: "New light green growth in spring; purplish upright cones develop in summer; remains evergreen in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike California White Fir, has shorter needles (about 1 inch) and darker green color; unlike Balsam Fir, has notched needle tips and grows only in southern Appalachians; unlike Subalpine Fir, has wider crown and grows at lower elevations"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A Christmas tree with short, soft, dark green needles"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a perfect Christmas tree with soft, short needles that won't poke you"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel soft and flat, and if you turn them over, you'll see white stripes underneath like tiny snow paths"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle to smell a sweet Christmas tree scent that many people love"
    fun_fact: "Fraser Firs are the most popular Christmas trees in America! They only grow naturally on a few mountaintops in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Where are you? Fraser Firs naturally grow only on high mountains in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia."
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If you're not in these southeastern states, you're likely seeing a planted tree or a different fir species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they short (about 1 inch), flat, dark green on top, and white underneath?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles are long, sharp, or don't have white bands underneath, it's probably not a Fraser Fir"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently bend a needle. Does it stay flat and not roll between your fingers? Also, look at the needle tip - is it notched or slightly dented?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If needles roll between fingers or have pointed tips, it's probably a spruce or different fir"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If there are cones, do they stand upright on the branches (not hang down) and have a purplish or brown color?"
        yes_next: "You found a Fraser Fir!"
        no_next: "If cones hang down or if the tree doesn't match these features, it might be another evergreen"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Light green new growth appears at branch tips; pollen is released from small pollen cones"
      reproductive_activity: "Male pollen cones release yellow pollen; tiny purplish female cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "New growth contrasts with older, darker needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches grow new light green 'baby needles' that are softer than the older ones"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures; upright purplish-green cones develop on upper branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow and mature, remaining upright on branches"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive upright cones are excellent identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see purplish-green cones standing up like birthday candles on the branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No change in needle color; cones mature and begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones break apart on the tree to release seeds; they disintegrate rather than falling whole"
      identification_tips: "Cone scales fall to the ground, leaving only the central axis on the tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones fall apart like puzzles while still on the tree, dropping their pieces and seeds to the ground"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; pyramid shape often accentuated by snow"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; cone axes may remain visible on branches"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive pyramidal shape stands out in winter landscapes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it stays green when many other trees are bare, which is why it's such a popular Christmas tree!"

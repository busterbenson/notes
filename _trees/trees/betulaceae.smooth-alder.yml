  summary: Smooth Alder is a multi-stemmed deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its smooth grayish-brown bark with distinctive horizontal lenticels, oval serrated leaves, and woody cone-like fruits. Typically growing 10-25 feet tall, it naturally forms thickets along streambanks, pond margins, and wetlands. Though not native to California, it might occasionally be planted in the state's landscapes with consistent moisture, valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, stabilize riparian areas, and provide wildlife habitat.

    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where the tree is growing. Is it near water like a stream, pond, or wet area?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Smooth Alder - they love having their feet wet!"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the trunk. Does the tree have multiple stems instead of one main trunk?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a different alder species - check White Alder which has a single trunk."
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Examine the bark. Is it smooth with horizontal lines that look like little dashes?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Probably not a Smooth Alder. Check other alder species with different bark."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small woody cone-like fruits about the size of your fingernail. Do you see any hanging on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Smooth Alder!"
        no_next: "If it's early spring, the cones might have released their seeds. Check other features again."

  look_alikes:
    - species: "White Alder (Alnus rhombifolia)"
      differences: "Native to California; single-trunked tree rather than multi-stemmed; lacks hairy leaf undersides; grows much larger (to 80 feet)"
      identification_tip: "If it has a single main trunk and is growing as a tall tree, it's likely White Alder, not Smooth Alder"
    
    - species: "Red Alder (Alnus rubra)"
      differences: "Native to coastal California; has reddish inner bark when scratched; larger tree form with more pointed leaves; leaf undersides have rusty hairs"
      identification_tip: "If you gently scratch the bark and see a reddish color underneath, it's probably Red Alder"
    
    - species: "Italian Alder (Alnus cordata)"
      differences: "Non-native ornamental; heart-shaped leaves; larger tree form rather than shrubby"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are shaped like Valentine hearts and it grows as a single-trunk tree, it's likely Italian Alder"
    
    - species: "Green Alder (Alnus viridis)"
      differences: "Smaller shrub; more mountain habitat; sharply serrated leaves"
      identification_tip: "If the teeth on the leaf edges are very sharp and pointy, it might be Green Alder"
    
    - species: "European Alder (Alnus glutinosa)"
      differences: "Non-native; notched leaf tips; more tree-like form"
      identification_tip: "If the leaf tips have a small notch (like someone took a tiny bite out of them), it's probably European Alder"

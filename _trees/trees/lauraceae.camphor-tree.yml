  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that smell like medicine or mothballs when crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "The smell is like cough drops, vapor rub, or the white moth-repellent balls sometimes used in closets"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth and shiny the leaves are - they're waxy on both sides"
    smell_tip: "GENTLY crush a leaf between your fingers and smell - the camphor smell is strong and distinctive!"
    fun_fact: "The camphor tree has been used for over 2,000 years in traditional medicine. It's the source of camphor, which is used in many products like moth repellents, some perfumes, and vapor rubs for colds. In its native Asia, the wood is prized for furniture because the smell helps keep insects away."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they smooth-edged, shiny, and evergreen?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Camphor Tree - try looking for other trees with different leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "GENTLY crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a strong medicinal smell like mothballs or cough drops?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Camphor Tree - check out California Bay Laurel which has a different spicy smell"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the overall tree. Is it a large shade tree with broadly spreading branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Camphor Tree!"
        no_next: "Might be a young Camphor Tree or a different aromatic tree - check the leaf smell again"

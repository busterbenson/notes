  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen conifer with flattened, lance-shaped needles arranged in spiral patterns around the branches. It has a distinctive pagoda-like shape with horizontal branches that droop at the tips, and reddish-brown, peeling bark."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flattened, sharp-pointed green needles arranged in spirals; pagoda-like tiered branching pattern"

    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays evergreen year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike most cypresses, has flattened needles rather than scale-like leaves; unlike redwoods, has stiffer, sharper needles that stick out more"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Sharp, flattened needles that stick out all around the branch, and a tree shape like a pagoda with branches in distinct layers"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like green starbursts stacked in layers, and the tree shape reminds you of a pagoda (a tiered Asian temple)"
    touch_tip: "Be careful! The needles are stiff and sharp at the tips - touch them gently along the sides instead"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a spicy, woody scent"
    fun_fact: "People in China have been growing these trees for over 8,000 years! In Chinese, the tree is called 'Shan Mu' which means 'mountain wood' because it grows on mountainsides. The wood is prized for building because it naturally resists rotting and insects don't like to eat it."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Does it have distinct layers of branches, almost like a wedding cake or a pagoda?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the tree has a different shape, it's probably not a Chinese-fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they flat, stiff, and sharp-pointed, sticking out all around the branches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the tree has soft needles or scale-like leaves, check for redwood or cypress species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling in long strips, especially on older parts of the tree?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the bark is different, it could be another conifer with similar needles"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the branch tips. Do they droop downward a bit, especially on the older branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Chinese-fir!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Chinese-fir, especially if it's young - check the needle arrangement again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new growth at the tips, like the tree is getting a haircut with light green highlights"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles; consistent dark green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones begin developing if tree is mature"

      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature"
      identification_tips: "May look slightly less dense as older inner needles drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "The tree stays green in fall, but might drop some older inner needles (that's normal, not a sign it's sick)"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; no significant change in appearance"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones may persist through winter"

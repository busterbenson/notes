  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A towering coastal evergreen tree with sharp, bluish-green needles and thin, flaky, purplish-gray bark. Produces hanging, papery cones and grows primarily in foggy coastal areas, where it can reach massive sizes with buttressed trunks."
  
  # Identification priority path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Sharp, bluish-green needles that are square in cross-section; thin, flaky, purplish-gray bark; grows in foggy coastal areas"
    secondary_markers: "Buttressed base on large trees; hanging papery cones 2-4 inches long; flat, stiff branches"
    seasonal_markers: "New bright green growth in spring; brown mature cones in fall; stays green year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Douglas-fir, has square needles and no 3-pronged bracts in cones; unlike Coast Redwood, has sharp needles and thinner bark; unlike other spruces, grows mainly in coastal fog belt"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super sharp blue-green needles that will definitely poke you if you grab them"
    memorable_comparison: "Like a Christmas tree with tiny swords for needles that grows where it can drink fog every day"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch ONE needle (don't grab!) - it will feel sharp and stiff like a little pin"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a needle to smell a strong, fresh scent like Christmas trees but more sour"
    fun_fact: "Sitka Spruce wood is so special that it's used to make the soundboards (the part that makes the sound) for the best pianos, guitars, and violins in the world! When you hear beautiful music, you might be listening to the sound of a Sitka Spruce tree!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, are you near the foggy coast of Northern California? Sitka Spruce loves to live where it's foggy and close to the ocean."
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If you're far from the coast or fog, it's probably not a Sitka Spruce"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a branch. Do the needles stick out all around it like bottle brushes and look blue-green?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles are flat or in bunches, it might be a different evergreen tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "CAREFULLY touch just the tip of ONE needle. Is it VERY sharp and stiff like a pin? (Be careful!)"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If needles are soft or flexible, it might be a different spruce or fir"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it thin and flaky with a grayish-purple color?"
        yes_next: "You found a Sitka Spruce!"
        no_next: "If the bark is thick, reddish, or deeply furrowed, it might be a Douglas-fir or redwood"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      differences: "Douglas-fir has softer, flat needles (not square); distinctive 3-pronged bracts in cones; deeper furrowed bark"
      identification_tip: "If needles are soft and flat (not sharp and square), it's likely Douglas-fir"

      identification_tip: "Location is key - Sitka is coastal, Engelmann is high mountain"
      
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright green new growth emerges at branch tips; may develop small pollen cones"
      reproductive_activity: "Yellow pollen cones release pollen; small purplish seed cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "New growth provides bright color contrast with older blue-green needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches grow bright green new needles that look softer than the older blue ones"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth hardens and gradually darkens; developing seed cones grow larger"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones continue to develop, changing from purple to green to light brown"
      identification_tips: "Growing cones and consistent blue-green needle color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the baby needles have grown up and turned sharp like the others, and the cones are getting bigger"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Consistent blue-green color; mature cones turn brown and open their scales"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones open and release winged seeds on the wind"
      identification_tips: "Open brown cones with thin papery scales"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown and open up like tiny wooden flowers to let their seeds fly away"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; empty cones may persist on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; may begin forming next year's reproductive buds"
      identification_tips: "Sharp needles, distinctive bark, and coastal habitat"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it stays green when other trees lose their leaves, and you can still see the pointy needles and flaky bark"

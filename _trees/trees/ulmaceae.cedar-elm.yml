  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with small, rough-textured leaves and a rounded crown. It has distinctive corky wings or ridges that develop on the branches, and its small leaves have double-toothed edges."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small oval leaves with sandpaper-like texture and double-toothed edges; corky wings or ridges on branches"
    secondary_markers: "Rounded crown with somewhat drooping branches; late summer to fall flowering (unusual for elms)"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow fall color; flowers and fruits in late summer to fall rather than spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Smaller leaves than American Elm; flowers in fall not spring; develops corky ridges on branches like Winged Elm but has smaller, rougher leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Small, scratchy leaves that feel like sandpaper, with branches that grow bumpy ridges like tiny speed bumps"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves feel like green sandpaper and the branches grow little ridges like mini-mountain ranges"
    touch_tip: "Feel how rough the leaves are - like sandpaper! Also touch the branches to find the corky ridges that stick out"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called Cedar Elm not because it looks like a cedar (it doesn't at all!), but because it often grows alongside cedar trees in its native Texas. It's one of the few elm trees that flowers in fall instead of spring - it's like it got the seasons mixed up!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, feel a leaf. Is it rough like sandpaper with small teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the leaves are smooth, it's probably not an elm tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the size of the leaves. Are they small (about as big as your thumb or a bit larger)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are large (bigger than your hand), check for American Elm or Chinese Elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Examine the branches. Can you find bumpy ridges or wings of corky bark growing on some branches?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Check for Winged Elm, which has more prominent wings, or Chinese Elm which has smoother branches"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, do you see tiny flowers or seed clusters? (Most elms flower in spring, but Cedar Elm flowers in fall!)"
        yes_next: "You found a Cedar Elm!"
        no_next: "It still might be a Cedar Elm - check the leaf size, roughness, and branch wings together"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:

      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge late in spring compared to other elms, light green in color"
      reproductive_activity: "No flowering activity (unlike most other elms)"
      identification_tips: "Late leafing helps distinguish it from other elms that leaf out earlier"
      kid_friendly_tip: "This tree is a late sleeper in spring - it gets its leaves after many other trees"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full crown of small, rough, dark green leaves; corky ridges more noticeable on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Flower buds may begin forming late in summer"
      identification_tips: "Look for the corky wings on branches and the rough-textured small leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, look for the scratchy leaves and bumpy branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow before dropping; overall pyramidal to rounded shape"
      reproductive_activity: "Small, inconspicuous flower clusters appear; followed by flat, oval, winged seeds"
      identification_tips: "Fall flowering and seed production is distinctive from other elms"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees are dropping seeds, this tree is making flowers - it does things backward!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal the overall shape; corky ridges on branches more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Corky wings or ridges on branches are most visible in winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the bumpy ridges that stick out on the bare branches"

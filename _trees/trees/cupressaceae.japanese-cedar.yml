  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall evergreen conifer with distinctive spiral-arranged, awl-shaped needles that form attractive upward-sweeping branches. Distinguished by its cinnamon-red fibrous bark that peels in long strips and small round cones about 3/4 inch in diameter."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Spiral-arranged awl-shaped needles curving upward; reddish-brown fibrous bark that peels in vertical strips"
    secondary_markers: "Small round woody cones with pointed scales; conical to pyramidal shape with a straight central trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green year-round; foliage may acquire bronze tint in winter in colder areas; cone maturation in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike redwoods, has awl-shaped (not flat) needles; unlike Giant Sequoia, has much smaller cones; unlike cedars, needles are not scale-like or in flat sprays"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Soft but slightly prickly needles that curve upward around the branches, and reddish bark that peels in strips"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like lush green bottle brushes, and the bark is shaggy like reddish-brown string cheese that's being pulled apart!"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the needles - they point upward and are softer than pine needles but still a bit prickly"
    smell_tip: "Crush a small bit of foliage to smell a pleasant, sweet woody scent"
    fun_fact: "Japanese cedars can live for over 1,000 years! In Japan, some ancient trees are considered sacred and have special ropes tied around them to show they're special. These trees are so important in Japan that they're the national tree!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Is it pyramid-shaped with upward-sweeping branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Japanese-cedar - try another evergreen tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Do they curve upward and wrap all around the twigs (not in flat sprays)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Japanese-cedar - if the needles are in flat sprays, check cedars or cypress"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling in long vertical strips?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another conifer - check redwoods or cypresses"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small round cones that are about the size of a large marble with spiky points on them"
        yes_next: "You found a Japanese-cedar!"
        no_next: "If the cones are very different, check other conifers"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new growth at branch tips and small yellowish pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tree gets bright green 'tips' on its branches, like it's growing new green fingers!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Foliage is uniformly deep green; new growth matures to match older foliage"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones continue developing, appearing green"
      identification_tips: "Look for small green developing cones and uniform green color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the whole tree is a rich green color, and you might spot tiny green cones forming"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Maintains deep green color, though may develop slight bronze tint in colder regions"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and turn woody brown"
      identification_tips: "Look for small round brown cones with pointed scales"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for small round cones that look like spiky Christmas ornaments"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "May develop bronze or reddish tint in cold weather; otherwise remains green"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones remain on tree; may begin developing next season's pollen cones"
      identification_tips: "Reddish bark stands out in winter landscape; foliage may have bronzy tint"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, some trees might look a little bronze-colored, but they don't lose their needles"

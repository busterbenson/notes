  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A majestic deciduous tree with large, heart-shaped leaves and sweetly fragrant pale yellow flowers that attract bees. Native to eastern North America but occasionally planted in California landscapes and parks. Valued for its soft, workable wood, bee-friendly flowers, and attractive dense shade."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Large heart-shaped leaves with toothed edges and an asymmetrical base; distinctive paper-like bract attached to flower and seed clusters; fragrant yellow flowers in drooping clusters"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark when young developing shallow furrows with age; lopsided leaf base (one side of leaf attaches to stem slightly lower than other side); pale yellow flowers with long flower stalks attached to pale green leaf-like bracts"
    seasonal_markers: "Fragrant yellow flower clusters in early summer; heart-shaped leaves turning yellow in fall; unique winged bracts with seed clusters persisting into fall and winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Distinguished from European Linden by larger leaves and less dense branching habit; unlike cottonwoods, has heart-shaped leaves with asymmetrical bases and distinctive flower bracts; unlike mulberries, has leaves without lobes and produces winged seed clusters"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Heart-shaped leaves with uneven bottoms, and flower stalks attached to special pale green 'wings'"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like valentine hearts with crooked bottoms, and the flowers and seeds hang from pale green paper airplane wings"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly fuzzy underneath but smooth on top"
    smell_tip: "When the tree has flowers in early summer, they smell super sweet like honey - bees love them!"
    fun_fact: "Basswood flowers are so sweet and produce so much nectar that beekeepers love to put their beehives near basswood trees to make special basswood honey. The wood is super soft and easy to carve, so many people use it to make musical instruments, toys, and even to carve sculptures!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they shaped like valentine hearts with one side of the bottom slightly lower than the other (asymmetrical)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "This is probably not a basswood - check for different leaf shapes"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "In early summer, do you see clusters of pale yellow flowers hanging down with a special pale green leaf-like 'wing' attached to each flower stalk?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it's not flowering season, check if it's a tall tree with a rounded crown and smooth to lightly furrowed bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the leaves fairly large (4-8 inches long), with tiny teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the leaves are much smaller or have big jagged teeth, it might be another tree with heart-shaped leaves"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree growing in a park, yard, or landscape setting (not a wild forest in California)?"
        yes_next: "You found an American Basswood!"
        no_next: "Basswoods are not native to California, so they're usually only found where people have planted them"
  
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Buds open and new leaves emerge, starting with a light green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Flower buds form as leaves develop"
      identification_tips: "Look for the emerging heart-shaped leaves with asymmetrical bases"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, watch for the valentine-shaped leaves popping out from the buds"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full, dark green foliage; distinctive drooping clusters of pale yellow flowers with attached pale green bracts appear in early summer"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom, attracting many bees and pollinators; small round nuts develop after flowering"
      identification_tips: "Fragrant yellow flower clusters with unique wing-like bracts make summer identification easy"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the tree makes super-sweet smelling flowers that bees absolutely love! Look for the special pale green 'wings' attached to the flower stalks"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow; small round nut-like fruits attached to wing-like bracts persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature; bracts act as wings to help disperse seeds by wind"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and distinctive fruit-bract combinations hanging from branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow, and you can see the seeds hanging from those special 'paper airplane' wings that help them fly in the wind"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Branches bare; some fruits and bracts may persist; reddish buds visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; fruit bracts may remain attached and help with winter seed dispersal"
      identification_tips: "Smooth to lightly furrowed gray bark; zigzag twigs with reddish buds; sometimes persistent fruit bracts"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the zigzag pattern of the twigs and reddish buds; sometimes you can still see some of the seed 'airplanes' hanging on the bare branches"

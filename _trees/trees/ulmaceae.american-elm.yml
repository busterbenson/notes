  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with uneven bases (one side attaches lower than the other) and double-toothed edges"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a giant fountain with branches that sweep up and then droop down at the ends"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're slightly rough on top, like fine sandpaper"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "American Elms used to line streets all across America, making beautiful green tunnels when their branches met overhead. Sadly, many have been lost to a disease carried by tiny beetles, but scientists are working hard to protect the remaining trees and breed new ones that can fight off the disease!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Does it have a vase-like shape with branches that go up and then arch outward and down?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the shape is different, it might not be an American Elm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they oval-shaped with uneven bases (one side of the leaf attaches lower than the other)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaf bases are even, it's probably not an elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaf edges. Do they have double teeth (big teeth with smaller teeth on them)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the edges have simple teeth or no teeth, it's probably not an American Elm"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's a mature tree, does it have grayish-brown bark with deep crisscrossing furrows?"
        yes_next: "You found an American Elm!"
        no_next: "It might be a young American Elm or a different elm species"

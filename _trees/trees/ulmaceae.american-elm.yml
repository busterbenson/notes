  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A large deciduous tree with a distinctive vase-shaped crown and gracefully arching branches that droop at the tips. It has doubly serrated, oval to elliptical leaves with asymmetrical bases, and bark that develops deep furrows and distinctive interlacing ridges with age."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with uneven bases (one side attaches lower than the other) and double-toothed edges"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a giant fountain with branches that sweep up and then droop down at the ends"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're slightly rough on top, like fine sandpaper"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "American Elms used to line streets all across America, making beautiful green tunnels when their branches met overhead. Sadly, many have been lost to a disease carried by tiny beetles, but scientists are working hard to protect the remaining trees and breed new ones that can fight off the disease!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Does it have a vase-like shape with branches that go up and then arch outward and down?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the shape is different, it might not be an American Elm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they oval-shaped with uneven bases (one side of the leaf attaches lower than the other)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaf bases are even, it's probably not an elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaf edges. Do they have double teeth (big teeth with smaller teeth on them)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the edges have simple teeth or no teeth, it's probably not an American Elm"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's a mature tree, does it have grayish-brown bark with deep crisscrossing furrows?"
        yes_next: "You found an American Elm!"
        no_next: "It might be a young American Elm or a different elm species"

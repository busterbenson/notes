  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall tree with reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips and scale-like leaves arranged in flat, drooping sprays. The branches spread out like fans and it has small oblong cones with thin scales."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Scale-like leaves that form flat, drooping sprays; trees smell spicy and sweet when crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Reddish-brown fibrous bark; branches that fan out and droop at the ends; flattened sprays of leaves"
    seasonal_markers: "Tiny brownish cones visible in late summer through winter; new growth appears brighter green in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Incense-cedar, has flatter sprays of leaves and lacks white X markings underneath; unlike Alaska-cedar, branches fan out instead of drooping like sad arms"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like fish scales and form flat sprays?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Western Redcedar - might be a tree with needles instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently squeeze some of the leaves and smell them. Do they have a nice, sweet forest smell?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Could be a different cedar or cypress - check the bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it reddish-brown and does it peel off in thin strips like string or paper?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Redcedar!"
        no_next: "Might be Alaska-cedar or Atlantic White-cedar - check if the branches droop down"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens)"

      identification_tip: "If the sprays are thick and stand upright instead of drooping, and the tree is shaped like a column, it's likely Incense-cedar"
    
    - species: "Alaska-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis)"
      differences: "Alaska-cedar has droopier, weeping branches that hang down like they're sad; its foliage is more blue-green"
      identification_tip: "If the whole tree looks droopy and sad, with branches hanging down, it's probably Alaska-cedar"

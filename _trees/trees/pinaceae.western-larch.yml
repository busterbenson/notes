  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "Western Larch is a tall, deciduous conifer with soft, light green needles that grow in clusters on short spurs and turn bright gold before dropping in fall. It has reddish-brown, deeply furrowed bark and small upright cones with distinctive protruding bracts. Unlike most evergreen trees, it loses all its needles each winter."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Soft, light green needles in clusters of 15-30 on short spurs; deciduous habit (drops all needles in fall); bright golden-yellow fall color"
    secondary_markers: "Tall, straight trunk with reddish-brown, deeply furrowed bark; small, upright cones with protruding bracts; pyramidal shape with a straight central leader"
    seasonal_markers: "Brilliant golden-yellow fall color; bare branches in winter unlike other conifers; bright green new growth in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike pines, has needles in clusters of many (not 2-5) on short spurs; unlike other conifers, drops all needles in fall; unlike other larches, has reddish bark and grows in western mountains"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Soft, light green needles in clusters like little brushes that turn bright gold in fall and then all fall off"
    memorable_comparison: "It's like a Halloween costume - a pine tree dressed up as a maple tree that changes color and loses all its 'leaves' in fall!"
    touch_tip: "The needles are super soft, not prickly like most pine trees - they feel like a soft paintbrush on your skin"
    smell_tip: "The needles have a fresh, piney smell but not as strong as pine trees"
    fun_fact: "Western Larch is a tree superhero! It can live for 700 years, survive forest fires with its thick bark, and grow over 150 feet tall - that's as tall as a 15-story building! And it's one of the few trees that's both a conifer (like Christmas trees) AND deciduous (loses all its needles in winter)!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the needles grow. Do you see them growing in little bunches like tiny brushes along the branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Western Larch - if needles grow singly or in groups of 2-5, check other conifers"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "If it's fall, check the needle color. Are they turning bright golden-yellow (like a yellow crayon)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it's not fall, look for light green, soft needles and check the bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the bark on the trunk. Is it reddish-brown with deep grooves, looking a bit like puzzle pieces?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Larch!"
        no_next: "Might be another larch species or a different conifer - check the cone shape and location"

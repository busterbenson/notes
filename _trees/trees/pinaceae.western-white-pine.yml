  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall, straight-trunked pine tree with bluish-green needles in bundles of five, slender cylindrical cones, and smooth gray bark when young that develops square plates with age. It grows in mountain forests and has a symmetrical, conical crown."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of five, straight, slender, and bluish-green; cylindrical cones 5-10 inches long; symmetrical crown with regular branching pattern"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark on young trees that develops into square plates; straight trunk; relatively thin, flexible needles compared to other pines"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as light green 'candles'"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Sugar Pine, has smaller cones without curved scales; unlike Whitebark Pine, grows taller with a straighter trunk and has longer cones; unlike Torrey Pine, has much thinner, more delicate needles"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tall, straight pine tree with bluish-green needles that come in bundles of five and long, slender cones"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like thin blue-green paintbrushes with exactly five bristles in each group, and the cones are shaped like cucumbers hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and flexible - gently run your fingers along them and notice they don't poke you like some pine needles do"
    smell_tip: "Carefully smell the needles for a sweet, clean pine scent (no need to crush them)"
    fun_fact: "Western White Pine trees can live for over 500 years and grow as tall as a 15-story building! They're sometimes called the 'aristocrat of pines' because they grow so straight and tall with such beautiful blue-green needles. Unfortunately, many of these trees have gotten sick from a disease called white pine blister rust that people accidentally brought from Europe over 100 years ago. Scientists and forest rangers are working hard to find and grow trees that can fight off this disease!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles. Do they grow in bundles of exactly 5 (five needles connected at the base) and are they thin, straight, and bluish-green?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Western White Pine - if there are 2 or 3 needles per bundle, it's another pine species; if needles are very thick, check Sugar Pine or Torrey Pine"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree's overall shape. Is it tall and straight with a regular, cone-shaped crown and branches that grow in distinct whorls around the trunk?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another five-needle pine - if very irregular or growing at very high elevations, check Whitebark Pine"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If you can see the cones, are they long (5-10 inches), slender, and straight (not curved)? Is the tree growing in a mountain forest?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western White Pine!"
        no_next: "If the cones are much larger with curved scales, it might be a Sugar Pine; if they're smaller, check Whitebark Pine"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as light green 'candles' at branch tips; male pollen cones produce yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new growth at branch tips and small yellow pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green 'candles' growing at the tips of branches - these will become new needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to bluish-green; developing cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones grow larger and begin to develop woody scales"
      identification_tips: "Young green to purple cones becoming visible; bluish-green needles distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and you can see green banana-shaped baby cones forming"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature, open, and release seeds with winged attachments"
      identification_tips: "Mature open cones may be visible before falling; some needle yellowing"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones open up like wooden flowers to release seeds with little wings that spin as they fly away"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen form stands out against winter landscape; symmetrical crown distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its blue-green needles when other trees lose their leaves"

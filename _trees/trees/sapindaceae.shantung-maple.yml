tree:
  common_name: "Shantung Maple"
  scientific_name: "Acer truncatum"
  family: "Sapindaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized tree with unique five-lobed leaves that have distinctively straight or truncated bases, rather than heart-shaped like other maples. The leaves turn beautiful colors from yellow to orange-red in fall, and the tree forms a neat rounded crown that provides good shade."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Five-lobed leaves with distinctively straight-cut bases (not heart-shaped); paired winged seeds arranged at wide angles"
    secondary_markers: "Glossy dark green leaves in summer; rounded crown with dense branching"
    seasonal_markers: "New leaves often emerge with reddish tint in spring; yellow to orange-red fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Norway Maple, has smaller leaves and no milky sap; unlike Trident Maple, has five (not three) lobes on leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:

    fun_fact: "This maple comes from China and is super tough! It can handle hot weather, dry soil, and even city pollution that would make other trees sick."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the leaves are arranged on the branches. Do they grow in pairs, directly opposite each other?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Shantung Maple - might be an oak or other tree with alternate leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at a leaf. Does it have 5 pointed lobes and a straight or flat bottom (not heart-shaped)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Shantung Maple - might be another type of maple with different leaf shape"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree small to medium-sized (not giant) with a nice rounded shape?"
        yes_next: "You found a Shantung Maple!"
        no_next: "Might be a different maple species - check leaf details again"

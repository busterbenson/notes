  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, dark green needles arranged in a brush-like pattern around the twig; strong balsam fragrance when needles are crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark with raised resin blisters; upright purple-blue cones that disintegrate on the tree; pyramid shape with a spire-like top"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright lime-green new growth in spring; minimal seasonal change as it's evergreen year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike spruces, has flat (not square) needles that don't roll between fingers; unlike pines, needles grow singly (not in bundles); unlike other firs, has very aromatic needles and smaller size"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Flat, soft needles with white stripes underneath that smell amazing when gently crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles are arranged like the bristles of a flat hair brush, and they smell like Christmas trees and forest candy mixed together!"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the needles - they're soft and flat, not pokey or sharp like spruce or pine needles"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a needle between your fingers to release the wonderful sweet forest smell that's used in air fresheners and Christmas decorations"
    fun_fact: "The bumps on the bark are tiny bubbles of sweet-smelling sap called 'blisters.' This sap was collected by pioneers to treat cuts and scrapes, and today it's used to make Christmas-scented products!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, gently touch the needles. Are they flat and soft, not sharp or prickly?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If they're sharp and prickly, it's probably a spruce, not a Balsam Fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how needles attach to the branch. Do they grow singly, not in clusters or bundles?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles grow in bundles (2, 3, or 5), it's a pine tree, not a Balsam Fir"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Flip over a needle. Do you see two white lines on the bottom side?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If there are no white lines, it's not a Balsam Fir"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Gently crush a needle and smell it. Does it have a really strong, sweet forest smell?"
        yes_next: "You found a Balsam Fir!"
        no_next: "If it doesn't have a strong sweet smell, it might be another type of fir tree"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright lime-green new growth appears at the branch tips; buds open"
      reproductive_activity: "Small pollen cones may release yellow pollen; young upright seed cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "The contrast between new light green growth and older darker needles is noticeable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green baby needles forming at the tips of branches - they look like tiny green candles!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Dark green needles throughout; seed cones develop and grow upright on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones mature, turning from greenish to purple-blue"
      identification_tips: "Look for the upright purple-blue cones growing on upper branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you might see purple cones standing up like little soldiers on the branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it stays dark green; mature cones may begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones break apart while still on the tree, releasing seeds"
      identification_tips: "The tree remains green while deciduous trees change color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees are changing colors, Balsam Fir stays green - and some cones might be falling apart on the tree"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No visible change; remains dark green throughout winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; will begin new cone development in spring"
      identification_tips: "Pyramid shape and dark green color stand out against snow or gray winter skies"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the tree looks like a perfect Christmas tree with snow on its branches - that's why it's often used as a Christmas tree!"

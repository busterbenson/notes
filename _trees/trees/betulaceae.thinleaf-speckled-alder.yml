  summary: Thinleaf Speckled Alder is a multi-stemmed deciduous tree or large shrub known for its dark bark with distinctive horizontal lenticels (speckles) and double-toothed leaves with rusty hairs along the veins underneath. Native to western North America from Alaska to New Mexico in mountain regions, it produces male catkins that emerge very early in spring before leaves appear, and female catkins that develop into small, persistent woody cones. While not native to California, this adaptable riparian species may occasionally be found in specialized wetland gardens or restoration projects.

  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark bark with distinctive horizontal light-colored speckles; small woody cone-like fruits that persist through winter"
    secondary_markers: "Oval leaves with doubly-serrated edges (big teeth with smaller teeth); rusty hairs along veins underneath leaves"
    seasonal_markers: "Male catkins appear very early in spring before leaves; leaves turn yellow to brown in fall; woody cone-like fruits visible all winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike White Alder, has multiple trunks and rusty hairs on leaf undersides; unlike Red Alder, has more prominent bark speckles and grows in mountains not coastal areas"

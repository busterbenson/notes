  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A critically endangered variety of Sweet Birch found naturally only in Smyth County, Virginia. This small deciduous tree or multi-stemmed shrub features dark, non-peeling bark with horizontal lenticels, ovate leaves with doubly-serrated margins, and a distinctive wintergreen aroma when twigs are scratched. With only a single small natural population, it's occasionally found in botanical collections and specialized gardens outside its native range, including California, where it requires cool, moist conditions to thrive."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark brown to almost black bark that doesn't peel; strong wintergreen scent when twigs are scratched"
    secondary_markers: "Ovate leaves with doubly-serrated edges; horizontal lenticels on bark"
    seasonal_markers: "Pendulous male catkins in spring; yellow fall color; visible catkin buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Sweet Birch, smaller with more shrub-like form; unlike River Birch, lacks peeling bark; unlike Black Cherry, has wintergreen scent and produces catkins, not cherries"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Dark bark that smells like wintergreen gum when scratched"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like smooth, dark chocolate and smells like mint gum"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the smooth, dark bark - it doesn't peel like other birches"
    smell_tip: "With an adult's help, gently scratch a twig and smell the mint-like scent"
    fun_fact: "This tree is super rare in nature - there are only a few wild ones in the whole world, all growing in one small area in Virginia!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it dark brown to almost black and smooth (not peeling)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Virginia Birch - check other birch trees with different bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "With an adult's help, gently scratch a twig with your fingernail and smell it. Does it smell like wintergreen gum or mint?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Virginia Birch - check black cherry or other trees with dark bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaf edges. Do they have double rows of tiny teeth (like a saw blade with big and small teeth)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Virginia Birch! This is a very rare tree!"
        no_next: "Might be another tree with dark bark - check the leaf shape and edges again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Pendulous male catkins 2-3 inches long appear in groups; smaller upright female catkins develop; new leaves emerge light green"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release pollen; female catkins are pollinated by wind"
      identification_tips: "Look for dangling male catkins and emerging leaves; wintergreen scent is strong in new growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for hanging 'caterpillar-like' catkins before or with the new leaves coming out"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full deep green color; female catkins develop into small cone-like structures"
      reproductive_activity: "Female catkins mature into small erect seed-bearing structures"
      identification_tips: "Look for deep green, doubly-serrated leaves and dark, non-peeling bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the leaves are fully grown and dark green, and you can still smell the minty scent if you scratch a twig"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn golden yellow, occasionally with orange tints; cone-like structures release winged seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds disperse by wind from mature cone-like fruit structures"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and dark, non-peeling bark remain distinctive features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn golden yellow and small winged seeds fly away from the little cone-like fruits"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leafless state reveals smooth dark bark with lenticels; male catkins for next spring visible on branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; male catkins formed for following spring"
      identification_tips: "The dark, smooth, non-peeling bark and winter catkin buds are key identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the smooth, dark bark without any peeling, and tiny catkins waiting for spring"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "Yellow Birch is a medium to large deciduous tree with shiny yellow-bronze bark that peels in thin, curly, horizontal strips. It has oval, double-toothed leaves that turn golden-yellow in fall, and produces small winged seeds in cylindrical catkins. When scratched, the twigs have a wintergreen scent."
  
  # Identification path

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Shiny, golden-yellow to bronze bark that peels in thin curly strips like ribbons"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like golden paper curls, like when you curl ribbons with scissors"
    touch_tip: "Gently scratch a twig and smell - it has a minty wintergreen smell like chewing gum!"
    smell_tip: "The bark and twigs smell like wintergreen gum or mint when scratched"
    fun_fact: "Yellow Birch can live up to 300 years - that's as old as the United States! Its wood is used to make ice cream sticks, and the sap can be boiled down to make syrup like maple syrup but with a wintergreen flavor!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it yellowish-bronze color that peels in thin, curly, horizontal strips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Yellow Birch - if the bark is white, check Paper Birch; if reddish, check River Birch or Sweet Birch"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully scratch a twig and smell it. Does it smell like wintergreen gum or mint toothpaste?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Yellow Birch - if no wintergreen smell, check other birches"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaves (in growing season). Are they oval with double-toothed edges (tiny teeth on bigger teeth)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Yellow Birch!"
        no_next: "Double-check by looking for small hanging catkins (spring) or golden-yellow fall color (autumn)"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A living fossil tree with unique fan-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow in fall. It has a distinctive upright growth pattern, with males and females on separate trees. Female trees produce smelly fruits, so male trees are usually planted in cities. Extremely long-lived and resistant to pests, pollution, and disease."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Unique fan-shaped leaves with parallel veins and a notch in the middle; bright golden yellow fall color"
    secondary_markers: "Irregular, often upright growth form; gray, ridged bark on older trees; male trees lack fruits"
    seasonal_markers: "Spectacular golden-yellow fall color; female trees have smelly round fruits in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "No other tree has the same fan-shaped leaves with parallel veins; maidenhair fern has similar leaf shape but is a small ground-growing plant"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves shaped like tiny fans with a split down the middle"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look exactly like the leaflets of a maidenhair fern, which is why ginkgo is also called the maidenhair tree"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's smooth with lines running from the stem to the edge like the folds of a paper fan"
    smell_tip: "Leaves have no special smell, but NEVER smell the fruits from female trees - they smell really stinky, like old cheese or throw-up!"
    fun_fact: "Ginkgos are living fossils that have barely changed in 200 million years - they lived with the dinosaurs and survived when most other plants couldn't!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf shape. Are the leaves fan-shaped with a split in the middle, like a tiny hand fan?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Ginkgo - no other tree has fan-shaped leaves like this"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaf veins. Do they run straight out from the stem to the edge, like the spokes of a tiny umbrella?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Ginkgo - ginkgo leaves have veins that run straight from the stem to the edge"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, look at the leaf color. Do all the leaves turn bright gold-yellow (not red or orange)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might not be a Ginkgo - they turn bright golden yellow in fall"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the bark of a mature tree. Is it gray with ridges or furrows?"
        yes_next: "You found a Ginkgo!"
        no_next: "If the tree is young, the bark might still be smooth - but the fan-shaped leaves mean it's definitely a Ginkgo"

    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; distinctive twig pattern visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no visible reproductive structures"

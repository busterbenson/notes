  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall, conical evergreen tree with flat needles, smooth gray bark with resin blisters, and upright purple-blue cones. It grows in high-elevation mountain forests and has a dense, symmetrical shape."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, dark green needles arranged to appear like a bottle brush around the twig; upright purple-blue cones; smooth gray bark with resin blisters"
    secondary_markers: "White lines on undersides of needles; needles curve upward; symmetrical, perfect conical form"
    seasonal_markers: "Purple-blue upright cones in summer; bright green new growth in spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A Christmas tree-shaped evergreen with flat needles arranged around the twig like a bottle brush, and purple-blue cones that stand up like candles"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like they're wearing fluffy bottle brushes because the needles point upward and outward all around the twig"
    touch_tip: "Feel the needles - they're flat and soft, not sharp, and have white stripes on the bottom"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently and smell the sweet, Christmas tree scent"
    fun_fact: "The scientific name 'amabilis' means 'lovely' in Latin - because foresters thought this was one of the most beautiful trees in the forest! The wood from Pacific Silver Fir is so light and strong that it's been used to make parts for airplanes!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where you are. Are you in a mountain forest, usually above 3,000 feet elevation?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not Pacific Silver Fir - it usually grows high in the mountains"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles on a branch. Do they curve upward and stick out all around the twig (like a bottle brush), and are they flat (not square)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be Pacific Silver Fir - check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Flip over a needle. Does it have two white stripes on the underside? And if cones are present, do they stand upright (not hang down) and have a purple-blue color?"
        yes_next: "You found a Pacific Silver Fir! Notice how the tree has a perfect Christmas tree shape with a pointed top."
        no_next: "If the needles don't have white stripes underneath, or if cones hang down, it's probably a different evergreen tree."
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright green new growth emerges at branch tips; pollen cones release yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male pollen cones release pollen; female cones begin to form"
      identification_tips: "Contrast between new growth (lighter) and older needles (darker)"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green new needles at the tips of branches - they look fresher and brighter than the older needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles; upright purple-blue cones develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow and mature, maintaining upright position"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive upright purple-blue cones are highly recognizable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see beautiful purple-blue cones standing up on branches like birthday candles"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No needle color change; cones mature and begin to disintegrate on the tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones fall apart on the tree to release seeds; they don't fall intact"
      identification_tips: "Scales from disintegrating cones often visible under tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones break apart while still on the tree - they fall apart like puzzle pieces instead of falling whole"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; snow often accumulates on branches due to dense foliage"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; cone axes may remain on branches after scales have fallen"
      identification_tips: "Conical form and upward-curving needles often hold snow distinctively"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the tree stays green and its dense branches are great at holding snow - sometimes looking like a tree wearing a white blanket"

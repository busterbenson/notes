  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen tree with a narrow, Christmas tree shape and flat, fan-like branches made of tiny overlapping scale-like leaves. The foliage feels soft to touch and has a pleasant spicy smell when crushed, while the reddish-brown bark peels in thin strips."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, fan-like sprays of scale-like leaves; narrow pyramidal or columnar shape"
    secondary_markers: "Yellow-green to dark green foliage; small elongated woody cones about 1/2 inch long"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright yellow-green new growth in spring; slight bronzing of foliage possible in winter"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Is it narrow like a Christmas tree or tall column?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Northern White-cedar - might be a different kind of evergreen"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the branches. Are they flat like fans with tiny scale-like leaves that overlap like fish scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Northern White-cedar - might be a pine or fir with needles instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently touch the branches. Do they feel soft, not prickly? And when you smell them, do they have a nice spicy scent?"
        yes_next: "You found a Northern White-cedar!"
        no_next: "Might be another scale-leaved evergreen - check the texture and smell again"

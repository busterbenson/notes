  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A dense evergreen tree with tiny, scale-like blue-green leaves and shreddy reddish-brown bark. It produces small blue berry-like 'cones' on female trees and has a spicy, pleasant aroma when the foliage is crushed. Often has a columnar or pyramidal shape when young, becoming more irregular with age."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Densely branched evergreen with tiny overlapping scale-like leaves; shreddy reddish-brown bark; fragrant foliage when crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Blue berry-like 'cones' on female trees; pyramidal to columnar shape when young; bronzy-purple winter coloration in cold areas"
    seasonal_markers: "Blue 'berries' (actually cones) mature in fall and may persist through winter; appearance mostly stable year-round as it's evergreen"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Western Juniper, has a more uniform pyramidal or columnar shape when young; unlike Italian Cypress, has blue berry-like cones instead of woody cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Densely branched tree with tiny scale-like leaves and reddish, stringy bark"
    memorable_comparison: "Like a green Christmas tree with shreddy, cinnamon-stick bark and blue 'berries' that birds love to eat"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the scaly leaves - they're softer than pine needles but might poke a little"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a few of the scale-like leaves between your fingers to smell a wonderful spicy scent like a cedar chest"
    fun_fact: "Eastern Redcedar isn't actually a cedar tree at all - it's a juniper! Its amazing wood smells so good that people use it to make special boxes for storing clothes, to keep away moths and make everything smell nice. The wood is so rot-resistant that fence posts made from it can last 50 years!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Is it tall and narrow like a column or pyramid, especially if it's not too old?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's very twisted and gnarly, it might be a different juniper species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it reddish-brown and peeling in thin, stringy strips?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the bark is gray and not stringy, it might be a cypress or another evergreen"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like roof shingles, covering the twigs?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the tree has needles or flat leaves, it's not an Eastern Redcedar"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Gently crush a few leaves and smell. Does it have a strong, pleasant spicy scent?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "If there's little or no smell, it might be a different evergreen with scale-like leaves"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "If it's fall or winter, look for blue berry-like cones about the size of a small pea. Can you find any?"
        yes_next: "You found an Eastern Redcedar!"
        no_next: "You might have found a male Eastern Redcedar (only female trees have 'berries') or it's not the right season"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears with brighter green color; may show bronze tinge fading from winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow pollen on male trees; females begin forming new cones"
      identification_tips: "Look for yellowish pollen cones on male trees; watch for new bright green growth at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, boy trees make tiny yellow pollen cones that release yellow dust if you tap them - they help make the berry-like cones on girl trees"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Dense blue-green to dark green foliage; berry-like cones developing on female trees"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones continue to develop, still green or beginning to turn bluish"
      identification_tips: "Look for dense foliage and developing berry-like cones on female trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the tree is dark green, and you might spot green 'berries' starting to grow on girl trees"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Berry-like cones mature and turn waxy blue; foliage may begin showing bronze tint in cold areas"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones fully mature and turn blue; seeds develop inside"
      identification_tips: "Blue berry-like cones are very distinctive; columnar to pyramidal form clear in landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for blue 'berries' that look like tiny blueberries - they're actually special cones with seeds inside"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "May develop bronzy-purple color in cold areas; stays green in milder climates"
      reproductive_activity: "Blue cones persist through winter; birds eat many cones and spread seeds"
      identification_tips: "Winter coloration, persistent blue cones, and evergreen nature in winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the tree might turn a bit purple-brown in cold weather, and you can still see blue 'berries' that birds haven't eaten yet"

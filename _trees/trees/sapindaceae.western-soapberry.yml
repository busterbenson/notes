  # Basic summary
  summary: "Western Soapberry is a medium-sized deciduous tree with compound leaves containing 8-15 pointed leaflets arranged along a central stem. It produces clusters of small white flowers followed by round, golden-amber, translucent berries that contain a natural soap. The tree has an irregular rounded crown and gray to brown bark with shallow ridges."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with 8-15 pointed leaflets arranged along a central stem; translucent golden-amber berries that persist into winter; leaflets often slightly curved or sickle-shaped"
    secondary_markers: "Gray to brown bark with shallow ridges; irregular rounded crown; small white flowers in clusters at branch tips"
    seasonal_markers: "White flower clusters in late spring; golden-amber berries persist into winter; yellow fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike ash trees, leaflets have smooth edges without teeth; unlike Black Locust, lacks thorns and has larger leaflets; unlike Tree of Heaven, has fewer leaflets and rounded berries instead of winged seeds"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Compound leaves with many smooth-edged leaflets, and golden see-through berries that contain natural soap"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like little feathers, and the golden berries look like tiny marbles that can actually make bubbles if you squish them in water!"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth along the edges (no teeth), and if you rub the berries in water between your hands, they can make bubbles like soap"
    smell_tip: "The crushed berries have a slight sweet smell; the leaves don't have a strong scent"
    fun_fact: "The berries contain natural soap! Native Americans and pioneers used to crush the berries in water to wash clothes and make bubbles. The name 'soapberry' comes from these special bubbling berries!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Do they have 8-15 smaller leaflets growing along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Western Soapberry - if leaves are simple (not compound), check other trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the edges of the leaflets. Are they smooth without any teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Western Soapberry - if leaflets have toothed edges, check ash trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's fall or winter, look for golden, round, somewhat see-through berries. Do you see them?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Soapberry!"
        no_next: "It still might be a Western Soapberry, especially if it's spring or summer. Check the overall shape (rounded) and gray-brown bark"

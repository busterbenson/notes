  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super skinny, tall tree that looks like a green rocket or pencil pointing to the sky"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a soldier standing at attention - tall, straight, and never spreading out"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel like tiny bumpy scales, almost like a bumpy plastic toy"
    smell_tip: "Crush a tiny bit of foliage to smell a fresh, spicy scent like cleaning supplies or air freshener"
    fun_fact: "Italian Cypress trees can live for 1,000 years! Some in Italy are as old as castles and were planted when knights and kings ruled the land."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the shape. Is it super skinny and tall like a green pencil standing on end?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an Italian Cypress - look for trees that spread out more"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny overlapping scales instead of needles or flat leaves?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not an Italian Cypress - check for trees with different leaf types"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check if the branches grow upward close to the trunk instead of spreading out"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not an Italian Cypress - try another cypress with spreading branches"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Very gently crush a tiny bit of foliage between your fingers. Does it smell fresh and spicy?"
        yes_next: "You found an Italian Cypress!"

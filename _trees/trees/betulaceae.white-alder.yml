  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous riparian tree with smooth light gray bark and shiny green leaves with finely toothed edges. It produces dangling male catkins in spring and distinctive woody cone-like seed structures that persist on the branches. Native to stream and riverbanks throughout California."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Grows along waterways; smooth light gray bark; leaves with small, regular teeth along edges"
    secondary_markers: "Small woody cone-like seed clusters that stay on branches; dangling catkins in spring; thin oval-shaped leaves"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow hanging catkins in late winter/early spring; cone-like seed structures visible year-round; bright green leaves in spring and summer, turning yellow or yellow-brown in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Red Alder, has lighter gray bark without orange tones and lacks rust-colored hairs on leaf undersides; unlike Arizona Alder, has smaller leaves with finer teeth"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree that grows next to water with smooth gray bark and tiny woody cones"
    memorable_comparison: "The smooth gray bark looks like elephant skin, and the little hard cones look like tiny pinecones but grow on a leafy tree"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth gray bark - it feels cool and sometimes has bumpy patches that feel like Braille"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild, fresh scent"
    fun_fact: "White Alder is a superhero tree! Its roots make special food for the soil that helps other plants grow better, and it helps keep stream banks from washing away during floods."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look where the tree is growing. Is it right next to a stream, river, or in a wet area?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a White Alder - they almost always grow near water"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it smooth and light gray, like elephant skin?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another kind of tree - try looking at willows or cottonwoods instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they oval-shaped with tiny teeth all along the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a White Alder - check for other trees that grow near water"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for tiny woody cone-like structures about the size of a marble. Can you find any on the branches or on the ground below?"
        yes_next: "You found a White Alder!"
        no_next: "If it's early spring, look for long, dangling yellow catkins instead. If neither is visible, check the leaf arrangement - they should grow in a zigzag pattern along the branch"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New bright green leaves emerge; male catkins elongate and release yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release pollen; female flowers develop into tiny green cones"
      identification_tips: "Yellow dangling catkins are distinctive in early spring before leaves fully develop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for long yellow 'caterpillars' hanging down (these are the flowers) and fresh green leaves just starting to grow"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of green leaves; small green cone-like seed structures develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones continue to grow and begin to harden"
      identification_tips: "Look for small green cone-like structures developing on the branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "The tree is fully dressed in green leaves, and you can spot tiny green 'pine cones' growing (but it's not really a pine!)"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to yellow-brown before dropping; seed cones mature to brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones mature and begin to open to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Brown woody cones are distinctive; yellow fall color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Leaves turn yellow like lemon drops, and the little cones turn brown and woody like tiny pinecones"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; woody brown cones remain on the tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins for next spring begin to form late in winter"
      identification_tips: "Persistent woody cones remain on bare branches; new catkins start forming late winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "After the leaves fall off, you can see the little brown cones still hanging on the branches like tiny Christmas ornaments"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall evergreen tree with upward-pointing branches and flat, fan-like sprays of blue-green leaves. The bark is reddish-brown, thin, and peels in vertical strips. Native to southwest Oregon and northwest California, it has a strong ginger-like smell when the leaves are crushed."
  
  # Identification priority

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches that point upward with flat, fan-like leaf sprays"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a Christmas tree holding its branches up to catch raindrops"
    touch_tip: "The leaf sprays feel flat like little fans or tiny green hands with lots of fingers"
    smell_tip: "Crush a small bit of foliage to smell a spicy, lemony-ginger scent - like Christmas cookies!"

    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the branches. Do they point upward instead of drooping down?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If branches droop down, it might be Alaska-cedar instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny flat pieces arranged in fan-like sprays?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Port Orford-cedar - check if it has needle-like leaves instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Carefully crush a small leaf and smell. Does it have a spicy, ginger-lemon smell?"
        yes_next: "You found a Port Orford-cedar!"
        no_next: "Might be Western Redcedar or another cedar-like tree"

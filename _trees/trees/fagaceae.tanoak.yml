  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen tree with shiny, leathery leaves that have toothed edges and tiny hairs underneath. The bark is gray-brown with deep furrows, and it produces acorns with fuzzy caps. Native to coastal forests and mountains of California."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Leathery oval leaves with pointed teeth along the edges; leaves stay on year-round; acorns with fuzzy caps"
    secondary_markers: "Gray-brown bark with deep grooves; leaves with fuzzy undersides; straight veins on leaves that end in the teeth"
    seasonal_markers: "Long dangling yellow flower clusters in spring; acorns develop in summer and fall; stays green all year"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike most oaks, keeps its leaves year-round; unlike madrone, has toothed leaves not smooth-edged; acorn caps are fuzzier than true oak acorns"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Shiny, leathery leaves with tiny teeth along the edges"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves feel like stiff leather with a fuzzy bottom side, and the acorns wear tiny fuzzy hats"
    touch_tip: "Feel both sides of a leaf - the top is smooth and shiny, but the bottom side feels fuzzy like velvet"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild, earthy scent"
    fun_fact: "Tanoak acorns were one of the most important foods for many California Native American tribes and were made into a special flour for bread and soup!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's leaves. Are they stiff, shiny on top, and have tiny pointed teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a tanoak - look for another tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Turn over a leaf. Is the bottom side covered with tiny fuzzy hairs that make it look whitish or golden?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a tanoak - try looking at a madrone or oak tree instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it deeply grooved with gray to reddish-brown color?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another type of oak or tree in the oak family"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's fall, look for acorns with fuzzy caps that look like tiny hedgehogs. Do you see any?"
        yes_next: "You found a tanoak!"
        no_next: "If it's not acorn season, look for old acorn caps on the ground. If you can't find any, check the leaf veins - they should run straight from the middle to each tooth on the edge."

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "Sweet Birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree known for its dark, shiny bark that resembles cherry bark and its distinctive wintergreen aroma when twigs are scratched. Not native to California, it features simple, ovate to oblong leaves with finely doubly-serrated margins arranged alternately on branches. The tree produces both male and female catkins and yields small, winged nutlets in cone-like structures. While primarily found in the eastern United States, it occasionally appears as an ornamental specimen in California's cooler regions."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark, shiny reddish-brown to black bark that doesn't peel; strong wintergreen scent when twigs are scratched"
    secondary_markers: "Ovate leaves with doubly-serrated edges; horizontal lenticels on bark"
    seasonal_markers: "Pendulous male catkins in spring; yellow fall color; visible catkin buds in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike River Birch, lacks peeling bark; unlike Black Cherry, has wintergreen scent and produces catkins, not cherries"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Dark bark that smells like wintergreen gum when scratched"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like smooth, dark chocolate and smells like mint gum"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth and firm - it doesn't peel like other birches"
    smell_tip: "With an adult's help, gently scratch a twig and smell the mint-like scent"
    fun_fact: "People once made wintergreen candy and soda from this tree's sap! The wintergreen smell comes from the same natural chemical that's in mint gum."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it dark brown to almost black and smooth (not peeling)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Sweet Birch - check other birch trees with different bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "With an adult's help, gently scratch a twig with your fingernail and smell it. Does it smell like wintergreen gum or mint?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Sweet Birch - check Black Cherry or other trees with dark bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaf edges. Do they have double rows of tiny teeth (like a saw blade with big and small teeth)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Sweet Birch!"
        no_next: "Might be another tree with dark bark - check the leaf shape and edges again"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Pendulous male catkins 2-3 inches long appear in groups; smaller upright female catkins develop; new leaves emerge light green"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release pollen; female catkins are pollinated by wind"
      identification_tips: "Look for dangling male catkins and emerging leaves; wintergreen scent is strong in new growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for hanging 'caterpillar-like' catkins before or with the new leaves coming out"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full deep green color; female catkins develop into small cone-like structures"
      reproductive_activity: "Female catkins mature into small erect seed-bearing structures"
      identification_tips: "Look for deep green, doubly-serrated leaves and dark, non-peeling bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the leaves are fully grown and dark green, and you can still smell the minty scent if you scratch a twig"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn golden yellow, occasionally with orange tints; cone-like structures release winged seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds disperse by wind from mature cone-like fruit structures"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and dark, non-peeling bark remain distinctive features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn golden yellow and small winged seeds fly away from the little cone-like fruits"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leafless state reveals smooth dark bark with lenticels; male catkins for next spring visible on branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; male catkins formed for following spring"
      identification_tips: "The dark, smooth, non-peeling bark and winter catkin buds are key identification features"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the smooth, dark bark without any peeling, and tiny catkins waiting for spring"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "A large, fast-growing deciduous tree known for its fragrant sticky leaf buds with a strong balsam scent. Has triangular to heart-shaped leaves with whitish undersides that shimmer in the breeze, smooth gray-green bark when young that develops furrows with age, and produces cottony seeds in spring."

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super-sticky, sweet-smelling buds in spring, and heart-shaped leaves that 'dance' in the wind"
    memorable_comparison: "The sticky buds feel like nature's glue and smell amazing, like sweet honey mixed with a forest smell"
    touch_tip: "Feel the flattened leaf stem - that's why the leaves wiggle so much in the breeze! But be careful with the buds in spring - they're VERY sticky and hard to wash off"
    smell_tip: "In spring, carefully smell the sticky buds - they have an amazing sweet smell like honey, cough drops, and forests mixed together"
    fun_fact: "The super-sticky, fragrant stuff on the buds is called 'balm' and was used by pioneers as a natural medicine for sore throats and chest colds. That's where the tree gets its 'Balm-of-Gilead' name!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the leaf shape - are they heart-shaped with toothed edges and pointed tips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Balm-of-Gilead Poplar - look at other deciduous trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Flip over a leaf - is the underside whitish or silvery?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Balm-of-Gilead Poplar - check other poplar species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In spring, check the buds - are they super sticky and smell sweet like honey or cough drops?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it's spring and the buds aren't very sticky and fragrant, it's probably another poplar"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Make the 'wind test' - do the leaves dance and make noise even in a light breeze?"
        yes_next: "You found a Balm-of-Gilead Poplar!"
        no_next: "If the leaves don't flutter easily, it might be another tree species"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Very sticky, fragrant buds open; hanging catkins appear before leaves fully emerge; leaves unfold with whitish undersides; females produce green seed capsules that later burst open with cottony seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Male trees produce reddish-purple hanging catkins; female trees produce greenish catkins that develop into seed capsules"
      identification_tips: "This is the best season to identify by the extremely aromatic sticky buds and catkins"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Spring is smell time! The sticky buds have an amazing sweet forest smell, and you'll see fuzzy catkins hanging down before the leaves come out"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of heart-shaped green leaves with white undersides that shimmer in the wind; cottony seed dispersal ends"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds have already been released; tree focuses on growing"
      identification_tips: "Look for dancing heart-shaped leaves with white undersides and the rustling sound in breezes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, watch how the leaves flip over and flash silver in the wind, and how they dance even in a small breeze"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright golden yellow; eventually all leaves fall off for winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree prepares for dormancy; next year's buds begin to form"
      identification_tips: "The golden yellow fall color and heart-shaped leaves are good identifiers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall brings a yellow glow to the tree as all the leaves turn the color of sunshine before dropping"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches; bark more visible; large, pointed, very sticky leaf buds visible on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds getting ready for spring"
      identification_tips: "Large, sticky winter buds and the grayish bark are best winter identifiers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, look for the super-sticky shiny buds on the bare branches - they're already making the sweet smell for spring"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Balsam Poplar (Populus balsamifera)"
      differences: "Balm-of-Gilead is actually a hybrid with Balsam Poplar as one parent; Balsam Poplar has more elongated, less heart-shaped leaves; extremely similar otherwise"
      identification_tip: "These are very hard to tell apart - Balm-of-Gilead often has more heart-shaped leaves with more rounded bases"

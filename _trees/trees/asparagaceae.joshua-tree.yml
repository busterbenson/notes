  # Basic summary
  summary: "A distinctive desert tree with spiky sword-like leaves clustered at the ends of thick, twisted branches. The Joshua Tree has a unique growth pattern with arms that split and branch in unusual directions, creating shapes that can look like a person with arms raised."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Spiky clusters of sharp, dagger-shaped leaves at the ends of thick branches that grow in unusual, twisted patterns"
    secondary_markers: "Pale green-gray leaves with sharp points; tree branches in unusual patterns with Y-shaped splits"
    seasonal_markers: "White or cream-colored bell-shaped flowers appear in spring; large oval fruits in summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Much larger than other yucca plants; has a thick, tree-like trunk rather than growing from ground level like Mojave Yucca"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A desert tree with spiky bunches of sharp, sword-like leaves at the ends of thick branches that twist and turn like arms reaching up to the sky"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a tree from a Dr. Seuss book, with branches going in crazy directions, each with a pineapple-like cluster of spiky leaves at the end"
    touch_tip: "Be super careful! The leaves are very sharp like swords. You can gently touch the thick trunk, which feels rough and shaggy like an old rope"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell in spring, but they're often too high to reach"
    fun_fact: "The Joshua Tree got its name because early Mormon settlers thought it looked like the Biblical figure Joshua raising his arms to the sky in prayer! These amazing trees can live for hundreds of years in the desert, and they depend on just one special kind of moth to make their seeds!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, are you in a desert area in Southern California? Joshua Trees only grow in certain desert areas."
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not likely to be a Joshua Tree - they only grow naturally in desert areas, especially the Mojave Desert"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the shape. Does it have thick branches that go in different directions with bunches of spiky leaves at the ends?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of yucca or desert plant - Joshua Trees have a special branching pattern"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they stiff, sword-like spikes that grow in dense clusters at the branch tips?"
        yes_next: "You found a Joshua Tree!"
        no_next: "Probably another desert plant - Joshua Trees have very distinctive spiky leaf clusters"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers appear at the ends of branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom and are pollinated by specialized yucca moths"
      identification_tips: "Look for creamy white flower clusters on mature trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bunches of white flowers that look like bells hanging from the ends of branches"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Green fruit pods develop after flowering; leaves remain green-gray"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruits mature and begin to dry"
      identification_tips: "Look for large, green, oval-shaped fruits developing at branch ends"
      kid_friendly_tip: "After the flowers are gone, green fruit pods about the size of small lemons grow in their place"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Fruits dry out and may begin to split open; leaves remain unchanged"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature inside fruits and may begin to disperse"
      identification_tips: "Look for brown, dried fruit pods; overall appearance remains the same"
      kid_friendly_tip: "The fruits turn brown and start to crack open, but the tree still looks the same otherwise"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes from fall; stays green-gray"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no flowering or fruiting"
      identification_tips: "Easiest to identify by distinctive branching pattern when no flowers or fruits are present"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter when other plants look dead, the Joshua Tree keeps its spiky green leaves"

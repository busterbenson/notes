  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Bright white bark that peels in paper-thin strips like nature's stickers"
    memorable_comparison: "The trunk looks like it's covered in white paper that's peeling off in strips"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels smooth and the paper-thin pieces peel away easily"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a fresh, slightly sweet scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "In its native Asia, people have used the paper-like bark for thousands of years to write messages on - it was like natural paper before paper was invented!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it bright white with thin papery strips peeling off?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Manchurian Birch - their bright white, peeling bark is their most noticeable feature"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a triangle or diamond with a long pointed tip and double-toothed edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch - check the leaf shape carefully"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "How are the leaves arranged on the branch? Do they alternate (zigzag pattern) rather than grow directly across from each other?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Manchurian Birch - their leaves grow in an alternating pattern"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In spring, do you see long, dangling catkins hanging from branches? In fall, are the leaves bright golden-yellow?"
        yes_next: "You found a Manchurian Birch!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Manchurian Birch, but look for catkins in spring or yellow leaves in fall to be sure"
  
  # Seasonal timeline

      identification_tips: "White bark contrasts with green leaves; triangular leaf shape with long pointed tip is distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the bright white bark looks like a cool white t-shirt against the green leafy 'sleeves'"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn brilliant golden-yellow; seeds are released from mature female catkins"

      identification_tips: "Bright white peeling bark is highly visible and distinctive in winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the white bark looks extra bright against dark tree trunks or snow - like a white ghost tree in the forest"

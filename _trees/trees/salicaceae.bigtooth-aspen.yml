  family: "Salicaceae"
  
  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth greenish-gray bark that becomes darker and furrowed with age. Distinguished by its coarsely toothed, oval to somewhat triangular leaves that tremble in the breeze due to flattened leaf stalks. Produces catkins in early spring before leaves appear, and turns brilliant golden-yellow in fall."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Coarse, large teeth on leaf margins; smooth greenish-gray bark on younger trees; trembling leaves in light wind"
    secondary_markers: "Oval to slightly triangular leaf shape; trees often growing in connected groups; straight trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright golden-yellow fall color; early spring catkins before leaves appear"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Quaking Aspen, has much larger, irregular teeth on leaf edges; unlike birches, has no peeling bark; unlike cottonwoods, has smaller leaves with distinctly larger teeth"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with big teeth along the edges that shake and dance in the breeze"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like green dinner plates with big, sharp teeth around the edges that never stop shaking in the wind"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth and cool like paper on young trees, and the leaves feel like thin plastic discs"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the bark has a faint sweet smell if scratched gently"
    fun_fact: "Bigtooth Aspens can create whole families of trees all connected underground by their roots - like tree brothers and sisters holding hands where we can't see them!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth and greenish-gray on younger parts of the tree?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough all over, peeling like paper, or dark brown, it's probably not a Bigtooth Aspen"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have extra-large, jagged teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves have small teeth or no teeth, it's not a Bigtooth Aspen"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently blow on a leaf or wait for a breeze. Do the leaves flutter and shake even in very light wind?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bigtooth Aspen!"
        no_next: "If the leaves stay still in light wind, it might be a different kind of tree"

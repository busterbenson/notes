  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous shrub or small tree that forms thickets along mountain streams, on steep slopes, and in subalpine regions. Features oval to elliptical, sharply toothed leaves that are bright green on both sides. Produces dangling male catkins in spring and distinctive woody cone-like seed structures."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Shrubby growth form; bright green leaves on both sides; grows in mountain habitats"
    secondary_markers: "Small woody cone-like seed clusters; dangling catkins in spring; sharply toothed leaf edges"
    seasonal_markers: "Yellow hanging catkins in late winter/early spring; cone-like seed structures visible year-round; bright green leaves in summer that turn yellow in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike White Alder, tends to be shrubby rather than a single-trunked tree; unlike Red Alder, has bright green leaves without rusty undersides; unlike Mountain Alder (A. incana), has glossier, more evenly toothed leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A bushy tree with bright green leaves that grows in mountains and has tiny wooden cones"
    memorable_comparison: "This tree is like a big shrub with leaves that look like they've been cut with tiny scissors all around the edges"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - both sides are smooth and bright green, unlike other alders that might feel fuzzy underneath"

    fun_fact: "Green Alders are mountain climbers! They grow at higher elevations than most other trees and help hold the soil on steep slopes to prevent landslides"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Where are you? Green Alder grows in mountains, often near streams or on steep slopes."
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If you're not in a mountain area, it's probably not a Green Alder"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Is it a bushy shrub or small tree that grows in a clump rather than having one main trunk?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Green Alder - they usually grow with multiple stems like a shrub"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they bright green on both sides with sharp teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If leaves are fuzzy underneath or don't have toothed edges, it's probably not a Green Alder"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Can you find tiny woody cone-like structures about the size of a small marble on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Green Alder!"
        no_next: "If it's spring, look for hanging yellow catkins instead. If neither is visible, it might be another mountain shrub"

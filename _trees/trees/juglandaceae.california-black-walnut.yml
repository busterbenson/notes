  # Basic summary
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with compound pinnate leaves and distinctive round, hard-shelled nuts. The tree has furrowed dark bark and an open, spreading crown with a short trunk often branching close to the ground."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with 11-19 leaflets that smell spicy when crushed; round, green walnuts in summer that turn brown and hard when ripe"
    secondary_markers: "Dark, deeply furrowed bark; often grows with multiple trunks or branches low to the ground; small tree with spreading crown"
    seasonal_markers: "Hanging catkins in spring; green walnuts in summer; yellow fall foliage; distinctive branch pattern visible in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike English walnut, has smaller nuts with thicker shells; unlike black walnut (Juglans nigra), has smaller leaflets and typically grows as a smaller tree"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with many small leaflets along a central stem, like feathers, and round walnuts that stain your hands brown if you pick them up without gloves"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like green feathers, and the walnuts are like tough little green balls that turn brown and hard, smaller than the walnuts you buy at the store"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're slightly fuzzy and smell spicy when you gently rub them. The bark feels rough and bumpy like alligator skin."
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf and smell the spicy, almost citrusy scent - but be careful, as the smell might stick to your fingers"
    fun_fact: "The California Black Walnut makes a special dark juice in its nuts and leaves that was used by Native Americans to dye baskets and color skin for ceremonies. If you touch the green nut husks, your fingers will turn brown and stay that way for days - like nature's finger paint that doesn't wash off!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have 11-19 smaller leaflets arranged like a feather along a central stem?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a California Black Walnut - check trees with different leaf patterns"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently rub a leaf and smell your fingers. Do they smell spicy or lemony?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a California Black Walnut - check other trees with similar leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In summer or fall, do you see round, green or brown nuts about the size of a small bouncy ball?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Black Walnut!"
        no_next: "If it's not nut season, check the bark - California Black Walnut has dark bark with deep grooves like alligator skin"

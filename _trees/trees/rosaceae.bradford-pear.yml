  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences)
  summary: "A deciduous ornamental tree with a rounded or oval shape and branches that grow in a distinctive upward pattern. It has glossy dark green leaves, a spectacular display of white flowers in early spring, and small brown fruits. Widely planted in California landscapes for its showy flowers and fall color."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Showy white flower clusters covering branches in early spring; glossy green leaves that are oval-shaped with finely toothed edges; upward-sweeping branch pattern"
    secondary_markers: "Dark green leaves that turn purplish-red to bright red in fall; small apple-like fruits that are brown and about the size of a marble; smooth gray bark when young"
    seasonal_markers: "Mass of white flowers in early spring before leaves appear; glossy green leaves in summer; bright red to purple fall color; bare branching pattern visible in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike apple trees, has smaller, harder, inedible fruits; unlike flowering cherry, has oval leaves not elongated; unlike crabapple, has more upright branching pattern"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Masses of white flowers covering the branches in early spring"
    memorable_comparison: "In spring, it looks like it's covered in snow with all its white flowers, and in fall, its leaves look like they're on fire with bright red colors"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth and shiny, like they've been polished"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a sweet smell, but some people think it smells a bit fishy or unpleasant up close"
    fun_fact: "Bradford Pear trees can grow super fast - up to 3 feet in a single year when they're young! That's like growing as tall as you in just one year."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "In spring, look for a tree completely covered with white flowers before most other trees have leaves. Do you see a tree that looks like it's covered in snow?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's not spring, look for other features. If it is spring and no flowers are visible, it's probably not a Bradford Pear"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves after they appear. Are they oval-shaped, glossy dark green, and have tiny teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Check if it might be a flowering cherry or crabapple instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check how the branches grow. Do they sweep upward in a pattern that looks like a fan or the letter V?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another flowering tree - check if it's a different pear variety or flowering fruit tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In fall, do the leaves turn bright red to purple-red?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "If it's not fall yet, look for small brown fruits about the size of a marble. If it's fall and the leaves turn yellow instead of red, it's probably not a Bradford Pear"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "Check where the tree is growing. Is it in a yard, park, or along a street rather than in a wild forest?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bradford Pear!"
        no_next: "Bradford Pears are almost always planted by people in cities and towns, not found in wild areas"

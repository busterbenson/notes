  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A unique conifer native to Japan with distinctive whorled needles that resemble umbrella spokes. Despite its name, it's not a true pine but the sole member of its own family. Slow-growing and highly valued as an ornamental specimen tree in gardens."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Distinctive whorled needles arranged like umbrella spokes; thick, glossy, dark green needles"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with dark green needles arranged in circles like umbrella spokes at the ends of branches"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like nature's umbrellas! Each branch tip has thick green needles arranged in a perfect circle, just like the spokes of a tiny umbrella."
    touch_tip: "The needles are thick and soft to touch, not prickly like most conifers. They feel like firm rubber strips."
    smell_tip: "Crushing the needles releases a mild, fresh scent that's not as strong as pine or cedar."
    fun_fact: "The Japanese Umbrella Pine is a living fossil! It's the only tree in its entire family and has been around since dinosaur times. Scientists thought it was extinct until they discovered it growing in remote Japanese mountains. The Japanese call it 'Koyamaki' and consider it a very special tree."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they thick, glossy, and dark green, arranged in circular whorls at the branch tips (like umbrella spokes)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Japanese Umbrella Pine - no other conifer has needles arranged this way"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Is the tree shaped like a Christmas tree (pyramidal) with a neat, orderly appearance?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Japanese Umbrella Pine, which keeps a pyramidal shape"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the needles thick and leathery (not thin like most conifers), around 2-5 inches long?"
        yes_next: "You found a Japanese Umbrella Pine! They're rare and special in California gardens."
        no_next: "If the needles are thin or short, it's probably a different conifer"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:

  # Look-alike species
  look_alikes:
    - species: "True Pines (Pinus species)"
      differences: "True pines have needles in bundles of 2-5 held together at the base, not in whorled arrangements; different cone structure; different overall texture"
      identification_tip: "Japanese Umbrella Pine has distinctive umbrella-like needle arrangements at branch tips, unlike any pine"
    - species: "Yew (Taxus species)"
      differences: "Yews have flattened needles arranged along the stems, not in whorls; produce red berry-like structures, not cones; different growth habit"
      identification_tip: "Japanese Umbrella Pine has unique whorled needle arrangements, unlike the flat spray-like arrangement of yew needles"
    - species: "Fir (Abies species)"
      differences: "Firs have needles attached individually to branches, not in whorls; different cone structure; generally faster growing"
      identification_tip: "The whorled needle arrangement of Japanese Umbrella Pine is unlike the evenly distributed individual needles of firs"

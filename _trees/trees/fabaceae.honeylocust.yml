  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with feathery leaves made of tiny leaflets, big branched thorns on the trunk, and long twisted seed pods that look like leather strips"
    memorable_comparison: "The thorns are like medieval weapons growing right out of the trunk, and the seed pods look like long, twisted leather belts hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "Feel the flaky, rough bark, but be VERY careful to avoid the large, sharp thorns!"
    smell_tip: "In spring, you might smell a faint sweet fragrance from the tiny flower clusters"
    fun_fact: "The Honeylocust's thorns can grow up to 6 inches long and often branch into multiple points like a tiny tree of spikes! These evolved to protect the tree from extinct giant ground sloths and mammoths that used to eat its leaves and pods millions of years ago."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look for feathery leaves made of many tiny leaflets arranged along stems (like a fern frond)"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Honeylocust - look for trees with different leaf arrangements"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the trunk and branches for large thorns (sometimes 3-6 inches long) that often branch into multiple points"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a thornless Honeylocust variety or another tree with compound leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In summer or fall, look for long (10-18 inches), flat, twisted seed pods that look like leather straps"
        yes_next: "You found a Honeylocust! The combination of feathery leaves, large thorns, and twisted pods is unique."
        no_next: "If no pods are visible, check again in late summer or fall when they develop"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"

      identification_tips: "Late leafing out; delicate, feathery foliage; small flower clusters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the leaves unfold like tiny green feathers all over the tree, and you might spot small clusters of yellowish-green flowers"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full foliage of fern-like compound leaves creating dappled shade; long green seed pods begin to develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pods grow throughout summer, gradually turning from green to reddish-brown"
      identification_tips: "Fully developed compound leaves; green pods becoming visible; thorns prominent on trunk and branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the tree is full of feathery green leaves that make spotted shadows on the ground, and long flat pods start growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright golden yellow; seed pods fully brown and mature, often with a twist"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature inside pods; pods begin to dry out"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and brown twisted seed pods are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn bright yellow like gold coins, and the seed pods look like twisted, flat, leather belts"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree loses all leaves; many seed pods remain hanging; thorns and zigzag branch pattern clearly visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; pods gradually release seeds or drop"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive branching pattern; large thorns on trunk and branches; persistent twisted seed pods"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter with no leaves, you can easily see the big thorns sticking out of the trunk and branches, and many twisted pods still hanging from the branches"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia)"
      differences: "Black Locust has once-compound leaves with larger leaflets, smaller thorns only at leaf bases, and shorter pods"
      identification_tip: "Honeylocust thorns are larger, often branched, and grow directly from trunk and branches; leaflets are smaller"

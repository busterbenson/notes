  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A graceful evergreen tree with a drooping leader (top), short, flat needles arranged in feathery sprays, and small oval cones. Distinguished by its lacy appearance and preference for cool, moist forests."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Drooping, flexible top (leader); short, flat needles of varying lengths arranged in feather-like sprays; delicate, graceful appearance"
    secondary_markers: "Thin bark with reddish-brown furrows; small oval cones about 3/4 inch long; grows in moist, shady forests"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as bright green at branch tips"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Mountain Hemlock, has needles arranged in flat sprays rather than all around the twig; unlike Douglas-fir, has shorter needles and drooping leader; unlike Grand Fir, has needles of varying lengths and a drooping top"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A graceful tree with a droopy top, short flat needles arranged like fern fronds, and tiny pinecones"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a Christmas tree that's taking a little bow, with branches like soft, flat, green feathers"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and flat, arranged in sprays like tiny ferns - run your fingers along them gently"
    smell_tip: "Crush a few needles very gently to smell a fresh, slightly sweet forest scent"
    fun_fact: "Western Hemlock can be a forest superhero because it grows in the shade of other trees! Unlike many trees that need lots of sunlight, Western Hemlock can grow up in the dark shadows of the forest under bigger trees. And it has a funny habit - it often grows on top of fallen logs or stumps, so you might see one with roots that look like stilts or legs reaching down to the ground!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the top of the tree. Does it droop downward like it's taking a bow instead of pointing straight up?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Western Hemlock - if the top points straight up, check if it might be a fir or spruce"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the needles. Do they form flat, feathery sprays like fern fronds with needles of different lengths along each twig?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles stick out all around the twig like bottle brushes, check Mountain Hemlock; if they're all the same length, it might be another conifer"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the cones if you can see them. Are they very small (about the size of a grape) and hanging down?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Hemlock!"
        no_next: "If the cones are larger or point upward, it's probably another conifer species"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears bright green at branch tips; small pollen cones may be visible"

      identification_tips: "Bright green new growth contrasts with older darker green needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new tips at the ends of branches, like tiny green paintbrushes"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to match older foliage; small developing cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones grow and begin to mature"
      identification_tips: "Small green to purple-brown developing cones may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, tiny cones about the size of grapes start to form and hang down from branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change in foliage; mature cones turn brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and release seeds with winged attachments"
      identification_tips: "Brown mature cones open to release seeds before winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the small brown cones open up to let their seeds fly away with tiny wings"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; some open cones may persist on branches"
      identification_tips: "Graceful drooping form and lacy appearance distinctive year-round"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it stays green and keeps its droopy top when other trees lose their leaves"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall conifer with flat sprays of scale-like leaves that give off a distinct aromatic fragrance when crushed. Recognized by its cinnamon-red, fibrous bark and distinctive 'duck-bill' shaped cones about 1 inch long."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, fan-like sprays of scale leaves; strong pencil-like 'cedar' smell when crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Reddish-brown, fibrous bark; narrow, columnar or pyramidal form"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change; small duck-bill shaped cones visible on mature trees"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Is it narrow and tall like a column or pyramid?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not an Incense-cedar - try another conifer"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the branches. Do they have flat, fan-like sprays of tiny green scales instead of needles?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not an Incense-cedar - if it has needles, check pine or fir species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a small piece of foliage and smell. Does it have a strong smell like pencil shavings?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another cedar - check for Western Redcedar which has a milder smell"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it reddish-brown and fibrous, peeling in long strips?"
        yes_next: "You found an Incense-cedar!"
        no_next: "Could be another cedar species - check bark color and texture"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges at branch tips with slightly lighter green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones release pollen in late winter to early spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for small yellowish pollen cones and fresh light-green growth at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the branch tips that are lighter green - that's the new growth!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Foliage is dark green throughout; new growth matures to match older foliage"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones begin developing, appearing green"
      identification_tips: "Consistent green color stands out against deciduous trees; developing cones may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when tiny green cones start to grow - they're shaped a bit like duck bills"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No significant color change as it remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and open to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Look for mature, open cones and seeds with wings"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees change color, Incense-cedar stays the same dark green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains dark green; empty cones may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones may form in late winter for next season"
      identification_tips: "Easier to spot when deciduous trees are bare; reddish bark stands out in winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, its green color and reddish bark make it easy to spot when other trees are bare"

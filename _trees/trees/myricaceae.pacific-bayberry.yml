  # Basic summary information
  summary: "An evergreen shrub or small tree with glossy aromatic leaves, waxy berries, and a rounded growth form. It grows along the coast and has leathery, toothed leaves that release a pleasant scent when crushed."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Evergreen, leathery leaves with small teeth toward the tip; strong aromatic scent when leaves are crushed; small waxy berries"
    secondary_markers: "Grows as a shrub or small tree; leaves clustered at branch tips; grows primarily in coastal areas"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A bushy evergreen shrub with shiny leaves that smell amazing when you crush them, and small waxy purple-black berries"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like small, shiny green spoons with tiny teeth around the edges, and they smell like a mix of bayberry candles and Christmas trees"
    touch_tip: "Feel the thick, leathery leaves - they're stiff and smooth with a waxy feel"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf and smell the wonderful aromatic scent - it's used in candles and soaps!"
    fun_fact: "The waxy coating on the berries was once collected to make bayberry candles that smell amazing when burned! These special candles were treasured because they didn't produce black smoke like regular candles made from animal fat."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where it's growing. Is it near the coast, often within sight of the ocean or in coastal forests?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not Pacific Bayberry - it's almost always found near the coast"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they evergreen, leathery, and spoon-shaped with small teeth only near the tips?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not Pacific Bayberry - check other coastal shrubs or trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a strong, pleasant aromatic scent?"
        yes_next: "You found Pacific Bayberry! If it's late summer or fall, look for small waxy purple-black berries on female plants."
        no_next: "If there's little to no scent, it might be a different coastal shrub - check wax myrtle or other coastal plants"

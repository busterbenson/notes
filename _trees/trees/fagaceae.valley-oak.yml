  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A majestic deciduous oak with deeply lobed leaves that can look like green mittens with long fingers. It has a massive trunk and broadly spreading crown, often growing to be the largest oak in California."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Very deeply lobed leaves with rounded lobes; massive spreading branches on mature trees"
    secondary_markers: "Light gray, deeply checkered bark; acorns with long, pointed tips and scaly cups"
    seasonal_markers: "Leaves turn yellow-brown in fall and drop; spring brings new bright green growth; acorns mature in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Blue Oak, has larger, more deeply-lobed green leaves (not blue-gray); unlike Oregon White Oak, has more narrow, deeply divided leaf segments"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with deep round-edged cuts that look like green mittens with long fingers"
    memorable_comparison: "Imagine a giant tree with leaves shaped like mittens that have really long, skinny fingers"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel smooth and not too thick, and the edges are wavy like gentle hills"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but the oak itself has a woody, earthy scent"
    fun_fact: "Valley Oaks can live for over 600 years and grow trunks so thick that 10 kids holding hands might not be able to reach around them!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf shape. Do the leaves have deep cuts that make them look like green mittens with long fingers?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Valley Oak - check if it might be another oak species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Is the tree very large with big branches that reach out wide from the trunk?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a young Valley Oak or another oak species - check the leaves more carefully"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, look for long acorns with pointy tips. Do the acorns have scaly cups and are they about 1-2 inches long?"
        yes_next: "You found a Valley Oak!"
        no_next: "If the acorns are different, check if the tree might be a Blue Oak (which has bluer leaves) or an Oregon Oak"

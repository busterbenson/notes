  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A majestic evergreen tree with dark green needles in clusters and a distinctive broad, flat-topped crown when mature. It has upright barrel-shaped cones and develops a massive, straight trunk with spreading horizontal branches that create a layered appearance."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Dark green needles in clusters (rosettes) on short shoots; distinctive flat-topped crown when mature"
    secondary_markers: "Upright barrel-shaped cones; horizontal branching pattern forming distinct tiers or layers"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays evergreen with new growth appearing lighter green in spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Dark green needles growing in tufts like little stars, with a flat top on older trees"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like a giant tree with shelves or layers of branches sticking out, and when it gets old, the top becomes flat like a table"
    touch_tip: "Careful! The needles are stiff and can poke - gently touch the sides of needles rather than the tips"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a wonderful woody, resinous scent like a forest"
    fun_fact: "Lebanon Cedars can live for over 1,000 years! They're mentioned in ancient stories and religious texts, and the flag of Lebanon features this majestic tree as its national symbol."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the needles grow. Do they come out in little tufts or clusters along the branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the needles grow singly or in bundles of exact numbers (like 2 or 5), it's not a Lebanon Cedar"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the color of the needles. Are they dark green rather than blue-green or silvery?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If they're blue-green or silvery, it might be an Atlas Cedar"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the branches. Do they grow straight out rather than drooping at the tips?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the branch tips droop downward, it's probably a Deodar Cedar"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If the tree is mature, look at its overall shape. Does it have a flat top rather than a pointy top?"
        yes_next: "You found a Lebanon Cedar!"
        no_next: "It could still be a young Lebanon Cedar - check other features like needle color and branch angle"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Atlas Cedar (Cedrus atlantica)"
      differences: "Atlas Cedar often has blue-green needles and a less pronounced flat top; Lebanon Cedar has darker green needles and more distinctly tiered branches"
      identification_tip: "Focus on needle color - Lebanon Cedar's are darker green without the bluish tint of Atlas Cedar"
    
    - species: "Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara)"
      differences: "Deodar Cedar has drooping branch tips and a more weeping form; Lebanon Cedar has horizontal branches that don't droop at the tips"
      identification_tip: "Look at the branch tips - if they droop downward like they're tired, it's likely Deodar Cedar"

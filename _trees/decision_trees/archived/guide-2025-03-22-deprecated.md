## CONFIRMATION TIPS

When you think you've identified your tree, check these additional features:

1. Smell a crushed leaf - many trees have distinctive scents:
   - California Bay Laurel: Strong eucalyptus/bay leaf smell
   - Incense-cedar: Sweet pencil shavings smell
   - Pine family: Fresh pine scent (varies by species)
   - Pacific Bayberry: Peppery smell

2. Look at the tree's habitat:
   - Coast Redwood: Cool, foggy coastal areas
   - Blue Oak: Hot, dry foothills
   - Valley Oak: Central valley and fertile valleys
   - Monterey Pine/Cypress: Central coastal areas (native range very small)

3. Check for seasonal signs:
   - California Buckeye: First to lose leaves in summer drought
   - Western Redbud: Bright pink flowers in early spring
   - California Black Oak: Brilliant fall color
   - Big Leaf Maple: Yellow fall color, enormous leaves

Remember: Real trees don't always look exactly like the book! They can vary based on age, location, and growing conditions.

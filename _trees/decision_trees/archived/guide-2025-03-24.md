# Tree Scavenger Hunt: A Kid-Friendly Guide to Identifying Trees in California

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
1. Find a tree (ideally in California)
2. Pick an entry point that matches your circumstances and what you can see
3. Follow the path by answering one question at a time
4. When you reach a tree name, check the confirmation features to be sure

## ABOUT THIS GUIDE
This guide is designed specifically for children ages 8-10 and uses a "genus-first" approach to make tree identification more accessible. This means:

- Common trees that kids are likely to encounter are described individually in detail
- Rarer species that look similar are grouped together by genus (tree family)
- All California trees are still included, but organized in a kid-friendly way
- The focus is on characteristics that are easy to observe and remember

The guide has been organized to help children successfully identify trees they're most likely to see, while still teaching them about all California tree species.

## CONFIRMATION TIPS

* Consider where you are in California:
  - Northern coastal: Expect redwoods, Douglas-fir, madrone
  - Central Valley: Valley oak, blue oak, sycamore
  - Southern California: More drought-adapted trees, palms
  - High Sierra: Mainly conifers (pines, firs, cedars)

* Look for clues in surrounding vegetation:
  - Grassy meadows: Oaks, buckeye
  - Dense forest: Firs, redwood, hemlock
  - Streamside: Alder, willow, cottonwood
  - Rocky outcrops: Gray pine, juniper

* Consider historical context:
  - Row plantings often non-native
  - Isolated big trees in fields often native remnants
  - Old homesteads often have fruit/nut trees

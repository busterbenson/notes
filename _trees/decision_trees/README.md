# "What Catches Your Eye?" Tree Identification Guide

This guide offers an intuitive approach to identifying California trees by focusing on observable features rather than traditional taxonomic classification. It's designed to be accessible to beginners, children (ages 8-10), and nature enthusiasts.

## How It Works

1. **Start with what catches your eye**: Instead of beginning with species or family, you start with the most noticeable feature (leaves, bark, flowers, etc.)
2. **Follow the decision tree**: Each path guides you through increasingly specific traits
3. **Reach identification**: The paths lead to genus and species identification

## Guide Structure

The guide is organized into separate files to make it more manageable:

### Main Feature Paths
- [`paths/index.md`](paths/index.md) - The entry point with links to all paths
- [`paths/leaf-needle-path.md`](paths/leaf-needle-path.md) - For identifying trees by their leaves or needles
- [`paths/cone-fruit-seed-path.md`](paths/cone-fruit-seed-path.md) - For identifying trees by their cones, fruits, or seeds
- [`paths/flower-path.md`](paths/flower-path.md) - For identifying trees by their flowers
- [`paths/bark-path.md`](paths/bark-path.md) - For identifying trees by their bark
- [`paths/smell-path.md`](paths/smell-path.md) - For identifying trees by the smell of crushed leaves or needles
- [`paths/shape-size-path.md`](paths/shape-size-path.md) - For identifying trees by their overall shape or size

### Special Paths
For trees with no single standout feature, these paths use detailed technical characteristics:

- [`paths/winter-detective-path.md`](paths/winter-detective-path.md) - Winter identification when leaves are absent (buds, twigs, persistent fruits)

## Features

- **Kid-friendly language**: Uses simple, accessible language for ages 8-10
- **"I'm Not Sure" options**: Help sections for uncertain users at key decision points
- **Difficulty ratings**: Star system (★, ★★, ★★★) indicates identification difficulty
- **Cross-navigation**: "What Else Can You See?" sections link to alternative paths
- **Seasonal indicators**: Icons and info about when features are visible
- **Visual emphasis**: Uses markdown formatting to create visual decision trees
- **Multiple entry points**: Identify trees based on whatever feature is most obvious
- **Progressive detail**: Move from general characteristics to specific species
- **Two-tier approach**: Main paths for obvious features, Detective paths for technical identification
- **California focus**: Covers both native and introduced species found in California
- **Seasonal flexibility**: Includes specialized winter identification when leaves are absent

## How to Use This Guide

1. Start at [`paths/index.md`](paths/index.md)
2. Choose the feature that first catches your eye about the tree
3. Follow the path, making choices based on your observations
4. Continue until you reach a species identification

If no feature of the tree particularly stands out:
1. Select the appropriate Detective Path based on what part of the tree you can observe (leaves, needles, bark, etc.)
2. Follow the more technical, detailed identification path
3. Use multiple characteristics together to make an identification

The guide also includes detailed leaf node files for notable tree groups:

## Interactive Versions

The guide is available in multiple interactive formats:

### Mind Map Version

We've created mind map versions of the complete guide for visual exploration of the decision tree structure:

- **[`paths/california_tree_guide_xmind_complete.xml`](paths/california_tree_guide_xmind_complete.xml)** - Complete mind map in FreeMind XML format that can be imported into XMind

### Interactive Web Implementation

For details on our approach to creating an interactive web version of the guide, see the [INTERACTIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](INTERACTIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) document, which outlines a comprehensive implementation strategy for a kid-friendly web interface.

## Notes

This guide uses a "What catches your eye?" approach rather than traditional taxonomic keys, making it more accessible for beginners. The hierarchical structure helps users narrow down possibilities based on observable features, regardless of botanical knowledge.

The project currently covers 165 tree species or genera found in California, including both native and introduced species, organized to be accessible to children and beginners.

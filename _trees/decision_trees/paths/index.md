# "What Catches Your Eye?" Tree Identification Guide (Genus & Species)

## Start Here: What's Most Distinctive About The Tree?

Look at the tree in front of you and ask yourself: "What's the FIRST thing I notice about this tree?"

```
What catches my eye about this tree?
│
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES look interesting! → [Go to Leaf/Needle Path](leaf-needle-path.md)
├── The CONES, FRUITS, or SEEDS catch my eye! → [Go to Cone/Fruit/Seed Path](cone-fruit-seed-path.md)
├── The FLOWERS catch my eye! → [Go to Flower Path](flower-path.md)
├── The BARK looks interesting! → [Go to Bark Path](bark-path.md)
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES SMELL interesting when crushed! → [Go to Smell Path](smell-path.md)
├── The OVERALL SHAPE or SIZE stands out most! → [Go to Shape/Size Path](shape-size-path.md)
└── Nothing really stands out about this tree... → See below
    ├── I can see the LEAVES up close → [Go to Leaf Detective Path](leaf-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the NEEDLES up close → [Go to Needle Detective Path](needle-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the SCALE LEAVES up close → [Go to Scale Detective Path](scale-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can only see the BARK up close → [Go to Bark Detective Path](bark-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the tree from a DISTANCE → [Go to Silhouette Detective Path](silhouette-detective-path.md)
    └── The tree has NO LEAVES right now → [Go to Winter Detective Path](winter-detective-path.md)

## About This Guide

This field guide uses a "What catches your eye?" approach to tree identification, rather than starting with scientific classification. Follow the path based on what feature you notice first about the tree in front of you.

Each path will guide you through a series of choices based on observable features, ultimately leading to identification of genus and species.

*Note: This guide focuses on trees commonly found in California, both native and introduced species.*

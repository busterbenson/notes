# "What Catches Your Eye?" Tree Identification Guide

## Start Here: What's Most Distinctive About The Tree?

Look at the tree in front of you and ask yourself: "What's the FIRST thing I notice about this tree?"

```
What catches my eye about this tree?
│
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES look interesting! → [Go to Leaf/Needle Path](leaf-needle-path.md)
├── The CONES, FRUITS, or SEEDS catch my eye! → [Go to Cone/Fruit/Seed Path](cone-fruit-seed-path.md)
├── The FLOWERS catch my eye! → [Go to Flower Path](flower-path.md)
├── The BARK looks interesting! → [Go to Bark Path](bark-path.md)
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES SMELL interesting when crushed! → [Go to Smell Path](smell-path.md)
├── The OVERALL SHAPE or SIZE stands out most! → [Go to Shape/Size Path](shape-size-path.md)
└── Nothing really stands out about this tree... → See below
    ├── I can see the LEAVES up close → [Go to Leaf Detective Path](leaf-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the NEEDLES up close → [Go to Needle Detective Path](needle-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the SCALE LEAVES up close → [Go to Scale Detective Path](scale-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can only see the BARK up close → [Go to Bark Detective Path](bark-detective-path.md)
    ├── I can see the tree from a DISTANCE → [Go to Silhouette Detective Path](silhouette-detective-path.md)
    └── The tree has NO LEAVES right now → [Go to Winter Detective Path](winter-detective-path.md)

## About This Guide

This kid-friendly field guide uses a "What catches your eye?" approach to tree identification, helping children ages 8-10 identify trees without specialized botanical knowledge. Follow the path based on what feature you notice first about the tree in front of you.

Each path will guide you through a series of choices based on observable features, ultimately leading to identification of genus and species.

## Special Features

This guide includes:
- **"I'm Not Sure" Options**: Help sections for when you're uncertain at decision points
- **Difficulty Ratings**: Star system (★, ★★, ★★★) to show which identifications are easier or harder
- **Seasonal Indicators**: Information about when certain features are visible
- **Cross-Navigation**: "What Else Can You See?" sections to try different paths if you get stuck

*Note: This guide covers 165 tree species or genera commonly found in California, including both native and introduced species.*

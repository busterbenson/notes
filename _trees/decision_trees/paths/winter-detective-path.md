# Winter Tree Detective Path

This path helps you identify trees when they don't have leaves, flowers, or fruits. Winter tree identification is like being a detective - you need to look for different clues!

## Winter Tree Detective Guide

### Quick Detective Tips
1. Look at the tree's shape from far away
2. Check if branches grow opposite each other or alternate (zigzag)
3. Look at the bark pattern and color
4. Check for buds and their arrangement
5. Look for anything still hanging on the tree (seeds, dried fruits, catkins)

## Remember These Winter Tree Detective Tips:

1. First look at the tree from far away - what shape is it?
2. Then check if branches are opposite or alternate
3. Get close and look at the bark pattern
4. Examine twigs and buds if you can reach them
5. Look for any seeds, fruits, or catkins still on the tree
6. Check the ground under the tree for fallen parts
7. Sometimes you need to use multiple clues together!

Note: This path is for deciduous trees that lose their leaves. If your tree still has leaves, needles, or scales in winter, use the Leaf/Needle Path instead!

## Scale Leaf Patterns and Arrangements

### 1. Flat, Fan-like Sprays
Trees with scales arranged in flat, fan-shaped patterns:

├── WESTERN REDCEDAR (Thuja plicata)
│   ├── Flat, fan-like sprays that form butterfly patterns

## Key Scale Leaf Characteristics to Check

### 1. Scale Arrangement 
Look closely at how the scales are arranged:

├── FAN-LIKE PATTERN
│   ├── Scales form flat, fan-shaped sprays
│   ├── Common in cedars, some cypress
│   └── Often has distinctly flattened appearance
│
├── ROPE-LIKE PATTERN
│   ├── Scales wrap around the stem in all directions
│   ├── Common in junipers, some cypress, sequoias
│   └── Creates a more rounded, dense appearance
│
└── CROSS-PATTERN
    ├── Scales form distinctive X or cross pattern on underside
    ├── Particularly noticeable in Incense-cedar
    └── Visible when examining underside of sprays

### 2. Scale Shape and Tips
Examine the shape and tips of individual scales:

├── POINTED TIPS
│   ├── Scales have sharp points that sometimes stick out from branch
│   ├── Common in junipers, some cypress
│   └── Often feels prickly to touch
│
├── BLUNT TIPS
│   ├── Scales have rounded tips that lie flat against branch
│   ├── Common in cedars, redwoods
│   └── Generally soft to touch
│
└── OVERLAPPING PATTERN
    ├── Degree of overlap varies by species
    ├── Tightly overlapping in junipers
    └── More loosely overlapping in redcedar

### 3. Scale Markings
Look for distinctive markings on the scales:

├── WHITE X PATTERNS
│   ├── Some scales have white X-shaped markings on underside
│   ├── Particularly visible in Incense-cedar
│   └── Requires close examination to see clearly
│
├── WHITE LINES
│   ├── Two parallel white lines on scale undersides
│   ├── Present in some cedars, redwoods
│   └── Represents stomatal bands (breathing pores)
│
└── RESIN DOTS
    ├── Small dots of resin visible on some scales
    ├── Present in certain cypress species
    └── May feel sticky when touched

### 4. Scale Color
Note the color of the scales:

├── BLUE-GREEN
│   ├── Alaska-cedar, Arizona Cypress
│   ├── Often has silvery or glaucous cast
│   └── Particularly visible on new growth
│
├── YELLOW-GREEN
│   ├── Western Redcedar
│   ├── Often brighter on new growth
│   └── May darken with age or in shade
│
├── DARK GREEN
│   ├── Incense-cedar, Monterey Cypress

│
└── SILVERY-BLUE
    ├── Arizona Cypress, some junipers
    ├── Distinctive bluish bloom on scales
    └── Especially visible in full sun

### 5. Scale Texture and Feel
Carefully touch the scales to feel their texture:

├── PRICKLY
│   ├── Western Juniper and other junipers feel sharp or prickly
│   ├── Young growth often more prickly than mature
│   └── Scale tips project outward from stem
│
├── SOFT
│   ├── Western Redcedar and other cedars feel soft and flexible
│   ├── Sprays can be bent without breaking
│   └── Gentle to touch
│
└── SMOOTH
    ├── Incense-cedar and redwoods have smooth scale surfaces
    ├── Scales tightly appressed to stem
    └── Often have waxy or glossy appearance

## Using Your Senses for Scale Identification

### The "Crush and Sniff" Test
Different scale-leaved trees have distinctive aromas when scales are crushed:

├── PENCIL SHAVINGS SMELL
│   ├── Incense-cedar (strongest, most distinctive)
│   ├── Unmistakable aroma of freshly sharpened pencil
│   └── Strongest when fresh scales are crushed
│
├── SWEET, SPICY-FRUITY SMELL

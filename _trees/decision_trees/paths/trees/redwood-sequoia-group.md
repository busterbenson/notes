# Redwood & Sequoia Group

These majestic trees are among the most iconic trees in California, including the tallest and most massive trees in the world. This group includes three remarkable species that are often confused but have distinct characteristics.

## Quick Comparison Chart

| Feature | Coast Redwood | Giant Sequoia | Dawn Redwood |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Scientific Name** | *Sequoia sempervirens* | *Sequoiadendron giganteum* | *Metasequoia glyptostroboides* |
| **Needles/Leaves** | Flat, soft, feathery | Small, prickly scales | Flat, feathery, deciduous |
| **Drops Needles?** | No (evergreen) | No (evergreen) | Yes (deciduous) |
| **Cones** | Grape-sized (1") | Egg-sized (2-3") | Small (1") |
| **Bark** | Fibrous, reddish-brown | Extremely thick, spongy | Shreddy, reddish-brown |
| **Natural Habitat** | Coastal fog belt | Sierra Nevada mountains | Not native to California |
| **Height** | Tallest trees on Earth (up to 380 ft) | Very tall (up to 250 ft) | Tall (up to 100 ft) |
| **Trunk** | Straight, relatively narrow | Massive, wide | Fluted, buttressed base |

## Coast Redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*)

### Key Identification Features
- **Needles**: Flat, soft needles arranged in feather-like sprays along branches
- **Cones**: Small, round, woody cones about the size of a grape (1 inch)
- **Bark**: Fibrous, reddish-brown bark that feels spongy to the touch
- **Form**: Extremely tall with narrow, straight trunk
- **Habitat**: Found naturally only in the coastal fog belt from Oregon border to Monterey

### Kid-Friendly Tips
- The bark feels like a giant sponge!
- It's the tallest type of tree in the world - taller than a 35-story building
- These trees can live for over 2,000 years and survive forest fires that kill other trees

## Giant Sequoia (*Sequoiadendron giganteum*)

![Giant Sequoia](https://example.com/giant-sequoia.jpg)

### Key Identification Features
- **Needles**: Tiny, scale-like needles that are somewhat prickly to touch
- **Cones**: Egg-sized woody cones (2-3 inches)
- **Bark**: Extremely thick (up to 2 feet), fibrous, reddish-brown bark
- **Form**: Massive trunk with more moderate height
- **Habitat**: Grows naturally only in about 75 groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada

### Kid-Friendly Tips
- The trunk is so wide that 10-15 kids holding hands might be needed to reach around it!
- The "General Sherman" tree contains enough wood to build 120 houses!
- The bark is so thick, you can gently push your finger into it like a sponge

## Dawn Redwood (*Metasequoia glyptostroboides*)

![Dawn Redwood](https://example.com/dawn-redwood.jpg)

### Key Identification Features
- **Needles**: Soft, feathery needles arranged in opposite pairs along branches
- **Seasonal Change**: Drops ALL needles in fall after turning rusty orange-brown
- **Form**: Conical shape with buttressed, flaring trunk base
- **Origin**: Not native to California; discovered alive in China in 1944 after being thought extinct

### Kid-Friendly Tips
- It's a "living fossil" - scientists thought it was extinct until living trees were found!
- It looks like a Christmas tree in summer but drops all its needles in winter
- The needles turn a beautiful rusty orange color in fall before dropping

## How to Tell Them Apart

### If the Tree Has Needles (Spring, Summer, Fall)
1. **Needles drop in fall?**
   - **YES** → Dawn Redwood
   - **NO** → Continue

2. **Needles are flat and soft?**
   - **YES** → Coast Redwood
   - **NO (small and prickly)** → Giant Sequoia

### If the Tree Has No Needles (Winter)
1. **No needles at all?**
   - **YES** → Dawn Redwood (deciduous)
   - **NO** → Continue to check bark and cones

### Check the Bark
1. **Extremely thick, spongy bark (can push finger in)?**
   - **YES** → Giant Sequoia
   - **NO, more fibrous** → Coast Redwood

### Look for Cones
1. **Cones are egg-sized (2-3 inches)?**
   - **YES** → Giant Sequoia
   - **NO, grape-sized (1 inch)** → Coast Redwood or Dawn Redwood

### Check the Location
1. **Growing near the coast in fog belt?**
   - **YES** → Likely Coast Redwood
   - **NO** → Continue

2. **Growing in Sierra Nevada mountains?**
   - **YES** → Likely Giant Sequoia
   - **NO** → Could be planted specimen of any species

## Fun Facts

- **Coast Redwood**: One of these trees named "Hyperion" is the tallest known tree in the world at 379.7 feet (115.7 m)!

- **Giant Sequoia**: The "General Sherman" tree is the largest tree in the world by volume - it weighs as much as 15 blue whales!

- **Dawn Redwood**: Once grew throughout North America millions of years ago but was thought extinct until living trees were discovered in China in 1944.

## Cultural Significance

Native California tribes, including the Coast Miwok, Yurok, and Mono people, considered these trees sacred. They used fallen wood and bark for building homes, canoes, and baskets. The trees were seen as ancient beings that connected earth and sky in spiritual beliefs.

Early European settlers logged many redwoods and sequoias for lumber, though Giant Sequoia wood was often too brittle for good construction. Today, most remaining old-growth groves are protected in parks and preserves.

## Conservation Notes

- Coast Redwoods and Giant Sequoias are vulnerable to climate change, altered fire patterns, and habitat loss
- Most remaining groves are protected in national and state parks
- All three species are planted worldwide as heritage trees and for conservation

## How to Tell Them Apart

### Step 1: Check the Bloom Time
1. **Early spring blooms?**
   - **YES** → Dogwood, Redbud, or Cherry
   - **NO** → Continue

2. **Summer blooms?**
   - **YES** → Crape Myrtle or Jacaranda
   - **NO** → Another flowering tree

### Step 2: Look at Flower Color
1. **White flowers (or bracts)?**
   - **YES, large 4-bracted form** → Pacific Dogwood
   - **YES, clusters of small 5-petaled flowers** → Possibly white Flowering Cherry
   - **NO** → Continue

2. **Pink to magenta flowers?**
   - **YES, emerging directly from branches** → California Redbud
   - **YES, in clusters along branches** → Flowering Cherry
   - **YES, crinkled flowers in summer** → Pink Crape Myrtle
   - **NO** → Continue

3. **Blue-purple flowers?**
   - **YES, covering whole tree** → Jacaranda
   - **NO** → Another flowering tree

### Step 3: Examine the Leaves
1. **Compound, fern-like leaves?**
   - **YES** → Jacaranda
   - **NO** → Continue

2. **Heart-shaped leaves?**
   - **YES** → California Redbud
   - **NO** → Continue

3. **Oval leaves with curved, parallel veins?**
   - **YES** → Pacific Dogwood
   - **NO** → Continue

4. **Oval leaves with serrated edges?**
   - **YES** → Flowering Cherry
   - **NO** → Continue

5. **Oval to elliptical leaves with reddish new growth?**
   - **YES** → Crape Myrtle
   - **NO** → Another flowering tree

## Fun Facts

- The showy white "petals" of Pacific Dogwood are actually modified leaves called bracts, while the true flowers are the small structures in the center.

- California Redbud flowers are edible and were used in salads by Native Californians. They have a slightly sweet flavor.

- The famous Washington DC cherry trees were a gift from Japan in 1912. Many flowering cherries in California are also Japanese varieties.

- Crape myrtles are sometimes called "the lilac of the South" because they thrive in hot climates while lilacs need cold winters.

- Jacarandas are native to South America but have become iconic in Southern California landscapes, especially in cities like Los Angeles and San Diego.

## Cultural Significance

Flowering trees hold special significance in many cultures:

- Pacific Dogwood is California's official state flower, chosen for its beauty and prevalence in California forests.

- California Redbud was used by Native California tribes for basket making, with the straight young branches valued for their strength and color.

- Cherry blossoms (sakura) are central to Japanese culture, symbolizing the ephemeral nature of life due to their brief but spectacular bloom.

- Crape myrtles are significant in Asian cultures, particularly in Vietnam where they symbolize elegance and endurance.

- Jacaranda trees are celebrated in festivals throughout their growing regions, with some cities timing graduation ceremonies to coincide with their peak bloom.

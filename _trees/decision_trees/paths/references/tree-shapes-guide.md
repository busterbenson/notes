### Round or Globe-Shaped Trees (Like a Ball or Lollipop)

**What it looks like**: A rounded crown that's often as wide as it is tall, like a big beach ball on a stick.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like a lollipop or a big fluffy cotton candy"

**Examples**: 
- Valley Oak: Enormous rounded crown with spreading branches
- European Beech: Dense round canopy with smooth gray "elephant skin" bark
- California Black Oak: Round-topped with thick, dark branches

### Oval or Egg-Shaped Trees

**What it looks like**: Taller than it is wide, with a rounded top and bottom that's wider than the middle.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like an Easter egg standing on end"

**Examples**:
- Blue Oak: Neat oval shape with light gray branches
- Bigleaf Maple: Oval crown with thick branches
- Oregon White Oak: Dense oval crown

### Pyramidal or Conical Trees (Christmas Tree Shape)

**What it looks like**: Wide at the bottom, coming to a point at the top, like a triangle.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like a Christmas tree or an ice cream cone upside down"

**Examples**:
- Coast Douglas-fir: Classic Christmas tree shape when young
- Norway Spruce: Symmetrical pyramid with drooping branches
- Giant Sequoia: Conical when young, becoming more columnar with age

### Columnar Trees (Like a Column or Rocket)

**What it looks like**: Tall and skinny, with branches that grow close to the trunk.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like a tall rocket ship ready to launch"

**Examples**:
- Lombardy Poplar: Very narrow, tall form with upward-pointing branches
- Italian Cypress: Super skinny, tall form with dense foliage
- Western Larch: Relatively straight and narrow compared to other conifers

### Weeping Trees (Branches Hang Down)

**What it looks like**: Branches that droop down toward the ground, like a fountain or waterfall.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like a waterfall of branches flowing down"

**Examples**:
- Weeping Willow: Long branches cascading to the ground
- Weeping Cherry: Ornamental tree with drooping branches
- Weeping forms of Birch, Beech, and other trees

### Vase-Shaped Trees

**What it looks like**: Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top, with arching branches.

**Kid-friendly comparison**: "Like an upside-down ice cream cone or a fancy water fountain"

**Examples**:
- American Elm: Classic vase shape with arching branches
- Chinese Elm: Smaller vase shape with more delicate branches
- Zelkova: Similar to elms, often planted as street trees

## How Tree Shapes Change

Tree shapes can change with:

### Age Changes
- Young trees often have more perfect, symmetrical shapes
- Old trees develop more distinctive, irregular forms
- Very old trees may have broken tops or multiple leaders

### Environment Effects
- Open-grown trees spread wide with full crowns
- Forest-grown trees reach upward and are narrower
- Urban trees may be pruned into unnatural shapes
- Windswept trees lean away from prevailing winds

## Using Shape for Identification

Tree shape is most useful:
- From a distance
- In winter when leaves are gone (for deciduous trees)
- For distinctive shapes that stand out in the landscape

Remember that tree shape can vary, so always check other features too!

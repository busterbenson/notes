# Leaf Types and Arrangements Guide

Trees have many different types of leaves. This guide will help you understand the main differences and give you the vocabulary to describe what you see!

## Simple vs. Compound Leaves

The first big difference in leaves is whether they are simple or compound.

```
SIMPLE LEAF                   COMPOUND LEAF
   ┌─┐                            ┌─┐
  /   \                          /   \
 │     │                        │     │
 │     │                   ┌────┼─────┼────┐
 │     │                  /│\  /│\   /│\  /│\
 │     │                 / │ \/ │ \ / │ \/ │ \
 └─────┘                /  │  \ │  X  │  / │  \
   │                   /   │   \│ / \ │/   │   \
   │                  /    │    X     X    │    \
   └────────────────┘      │   / \   / \   │
                           │  /   \ /   \  │
                           │ /     X     \ │
                           │/     / \     \│
                           X     /   \     X
                          / \   /     \   / \
                         /   \ /       \ /   \
```

### Simple Leaves
- **What they are**: One single leaf blade with one stem (petiole)
- **How to recognize**: Each leaf attaches separately to the branch
- **Examples**: Oak leaves, maple leaves, apple leaves

### Compound Leaves
- **What they are**: Multiple small leaflets that make up one whole leaf
- **How to recognize**: Look for where the stem attaches to the main branch - all leaflets connected to one stem count as one leaf!
- **Examples**: Ash leaves, walnut leaves, locust leaves

### Kid-friendly tip
How can you tell if it's a compound leaf or just small simple leaves? Look for the bud! A bud is found at the base of each leaf (where it connects to the branch), but not at the base of each leaflet on a compound leaf.

## Leaf Arrangements on Branches

How leaves attach to the branches is another important clue for identifying trees.

   │                                └─┘                   │
```

### Opposite Arrangement
- **What it is**: Leaves grow in pairs directly across from each other
- **How to recognize**: Like butterfly wings or your arms stretching out
- **Easy trick**: Remember MAD - Maple, Ash, Dogwood (most common opposite-leaved trees)
- **Examples**: Maple, ash, dogwood, some viburnums

### Alternate Arrangement
- **What it is**: Leaves grow one at a time, alternating sides along the branch
- **How to recognize**: Zigzag pattern like a lightning bolt
- **Examples**: Oak, birch, elm, apple, cherry, most trees!

### Whorled Arrangement
- **What it is**: Three or more leaves attach at the same point around the stem
- **How to recognize**: Like a star pattern or pinwheel when viewed from above
- **Examples**: Catalpa, some dogwoods, redbuds (rare in trees, more common in shrubs)

## Leaf Margins (Edges)

The edges of leaves give important clues for tree identification.

    └───┘              └────┘         └─╱  ╲─┘           └───────┘
```

### Smooth/Entire Margins
- **What they are**: Leaf edges with no teeth or lobes
- **How to recognize**: The edge looks smooth like the edge of paper
- **Examples**: Magnolia, dogwood, rhododendron

### Toothed/Serrated Margins
- **What they are**: Leaf edges with tiny "teeth" or points
- **How to recognize**: Like the edge of a saw blade or shark teeth
- **Examples**: Birch, elm, cherry, apple

### Lobed Margins
- **What they are**: Leaf edges with deep rounded or pointed indentations
- **How to recognize**: Like a hand with fingers or puzzle pieces
- **Examples**: Oak, maple, sycamore

### Wavy Margins
- **What they are**: Leaf edges that gently curve in and out
- **How to recognize**: Like gentle waves or ripples on water
- **Examples**: Beech, some oaks, witch hazel

## Leaf Shapes

Trees have leaves with many different overall shapes.

## Types of Compound Leaves

If a leaf is compound, it can be arranged in different patterns.

### Pinnate Compound Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaflets arranged along a central stem, like a feather
- **How to recognize**: Like a line of small leaves on each side of a central stem
- **Examples**: Ash, walnut, pecan, locust

### Bipinnate Compound Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaflets are themselves divided, creating a double-compound pattern
- **How to recognize**: Like a feather with smaller feathers attached
- **Examples**: Honey locust, Kentucky coffee tree, mimosa

### Palmate Compound Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaflets all attach at the same point, spreading like fingers
- **How to recognize**: Like fingers spreading from your palm or a star pattern
- **Examples**: Buckeye, horse chestnut

## Leaf Textures

Leaves can feel different when you touch them.

### Smooth Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaves with a sleek surface
- **How to recognize**: Feel slippery or waxy when touched
- **Examples**: Magnolia, holly, some maples

### Rough Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaves with a rough or sandpapery texture
- **How to recognize**: Feel scratchy when you run your finger across them
- **Examples**: Elm, hackberry, sycamore

### Hairy/Fuzzy Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaves covered with tiny hairs or fuzz
- **How to recognize**: Feel soft like a fuzzy blanket or pet fur
- **Examples**: Silver maple (underside), mullein, some oaks

### Waxy Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaves with a waxy coating that often feels thick
- **How to recognize**: Often shiny, water beads up on them
- **Examples**: Holly, madrone, some rhododendrons

## Special Leaf Features

Some leaves have special characteristics that make identification easier!

### Aromatic Leaves
- **What they are**: Leaves that release a strong smell when crushed
- **Examples**:
  - Eucalyptus: Medicinal smell
  - Bay laurel: Spicy cooking smell
  - Camphor: Strong menthol smell
  - Walnut: Strong, distinct smell

### Asymmetrical Leaves
- **What they are**: The leaf blade is uneven at the base (one side attaches lower than the other)
- **Examples**:
  - Elm: Classic lopsided leaf base
  - Hackberry: Noticeably uneven base
  - Linden/Basswood: Heart-shaped but asymmetrical

### Unusual Colors
- **What they are**: Leaves with colors other than typical green
- **Examples**:
  - Silver maple: Silver-white underside
  - White oak: Pale bluish-green
  - Purple-leaf plum: Deep purple
  - Variegated plants: Leaves with stripes or patches of different colors

## Remember:

1. First check if a leaf is simple (one blade) or compound (multiple leaflets)
2. Look how leaves are arranged on the branch (opposite, alternate, or whorled)
3. Notice the leaf edge (smooth, toothed, lobed, or wavy)
4. Observe the overall shape
5. Feel the texture
6. Look for any special features like smell or color

These leaf features combine to create a unique "fingerprint" for identifying different trees!

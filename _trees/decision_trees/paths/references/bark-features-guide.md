# Bark Features Guide

Bark is like a tree's "skin" and can be one of the most helpful features for identifying trees, especially in winter! This guide will help you understand different bark types.

## Understanding Bark

Bark is the outer protective layer of a tree's trunk and branches. Just like people have different skin, trees have different bark!

## Main Bark Colors

### WHITE or LIGHT-COLORED BARK
- **Bright White**: Paper Birch, White Poplar
- **Creamy White**: Sycamore (with patches), some Birch species
- **Pale Gray**: Beech, Aspen, many Maple species
- **Silver-Gray**: White Alder, some Eucalyptus species

### RED, ORANGE, or BROWN BARK
- **Cinnamon-Red**: Madrone, Manzanita, some Redwoods
- **Rusty-Red**: Coast Redwood, Sequoia, some Pines
- **Reddish-Brown**: Cherry, some Pines, Western Larch
- **Coppery**: River Birch, some Birch species

### DARK-COLORED BARK
- **Dark Brown**: Black Oak, Black Walnut, Douglas-fir
- **Nearly Black**: Black Locust, older California Black Oak
- **Dark Gray**: London Plane Tree, mature White Oak

### COLORFUL or UNUSUAL BARK
- **Green-Tinged**: Aspen (younger), Madrone, some Maple species

- **Like Armor**: Thick, flat plates or square/rectangular blocks
- **Examples**: Older Ponderosa Pine, Douglas-fir, Black Oak
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like squares of chocolate on a chocolate bar" or "like alligator skin"

### PEELING or FLAKING BARK
- **Like Peeling Paint**: Bark that peels or flakes off
- **Different Types**:
  - **Paper-like Sheets**: Birch, some Eucalyptus
  - **Curling Strips**: Madrone, Manzanita
  - **Small Flakes**: Cherry, Sycamore
  - **Jigsaw Pieces**: Sycamore, London Plane Tree
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like peeling sunburned skin" or "like peeling paint"

### SHAGGY or SHREDDING BARK

## Special Bark Features

### LENTICELS
- **What They Are**: Small dots or dash marks on bark (breathing pores)
- **Examples**: 
  - **Horizontal Lines**: Birch, Cherry
  - **Raised Dots**: Alder, some Maples
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like tiny breathing holes or freckles on the tree"

### THORNS or SPINES
- **What They Are**: Sharp pointy parts growing from the bark
- **Examples**:
  - **Branched Thorns**: Honey Locust (big branched thorns)
  - **Paired Thorns**: Black Locust (small paired thorns)
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like the tree is wearing armor with spikes"

## Famous Bark Types

### "CAMOUFLAGE" or "PUZZLE PIECE" BARK
- **What It Looks Like**: Multi-colored patches that flake off
- **Examples**: California Sycamore, London Plane Tree
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like a soldier's camouflage uniform" or "like puzzle pieces"

### "PAPER" BARK
- **What It Looks Like**: White bark that peels in thin sheets
- **Examples**: Paper Birch, Canoe Birch
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Like sheets of paper you could write on"

### "ELEPHANT SKIN" BARK
- **What It Looks Like**: Smooth, gray bark
- **Examples**: Beech, young Maple
- **Kid-Friendly Comparison**: "Smooth and gray just like an elephant's skin"

## How Bark Changes

### Age Changes
- Young trees often have **smoother** bark
- As trees grow, bark often becomes **rougher**
- Very old trees may have **extremely thick** or **deeply furrowed** bark
- Example: Douglas-fir starts smooth, becomes plated, then deeply furrowed

### Environmental Effects
- Urban trees may have **damaged bark** from people/cars
- Trees in fire-prone areas may have **fire scars**
- Trees in windy areas may have **tougher bark** on the windward side

## Bark ID Practice Tips

1. **Touch the bark** (if it's safe) - is it smooth, rough, peeling?
2. **Look at the color pattern** - is it one color or patchy?
3. **Step back and look** at the overall pattern from a distance
4. **Compare different sides** of the tree - bark can vary around the trunk
5. **Check several trees** of the same type - bark can vary by age

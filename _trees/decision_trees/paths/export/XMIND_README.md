# XMind-Optimized California Tree Guide

This directory contains `california_tree_guide.xmind`, the official XMind format file for the California Tree Guide. This file is automatically generated from the markdown source files and maintains proper hierarchical structure.

## About This File

The `california_tree_guide.xmind` file contains:

- A complete representation of the California Tree Identification Guide decision tree
- All tree species organized by observable features
- Proper nesting of questions and their answers at each decision point
- Generated directly from the markdown source files

## Opening in XMind

1. **Launch XMind**: Open your XMind application
2. **Open the File**:
   - Click on "File" > "Open"
   - Navigate to and select `california_tree_guide.xmind`
   - Click "Open"

## Navigation Tips

This mind map is organized by what first catches your eye about a tree:

- **LEAVES or NEEDLES**: Start here if leaves or needles are the most noticeable feature
- **BARK**: Start here if the bark texture or color stands out
- **CONES, FRUITS, or SEEDS**: Start here if reproductive structures are visible
- **FLOWERS**: Start here if the tree has noticeable flowers
- **SMELL**: Start here if the crushed leaves or needles have a distinctive aroma
- **SHAPE or SIZE**: Start here if the overall tree form is most distinctive
- **TRUNK SHAPE**: Start here if the trunk form is unusual or distinctive
- **NO LEAVES**: Start here for winter identification of deciduous trees

## Regenerating the XMind File

If you have made changes to the markdown files and need to regenerate the XMind file:

```bash
python3 /Users/buster/projects/notes/_trees/scripts/utilities/markdown_to_xmind_complete.py
```

This will:
1. Process all path files in the decision_trees/paths directory
2. Generate a new XMind file in the export directory
3. Maintain node consistency using the mapping file

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the XMind file:

1. **Missing Paths**: Check that all paths are included in the file by opening all main branches
2. **Improper Nesting**: Verify that questions and their answers are properly nested
3. **XMind Won't Open File**: The file may be corrupted - regenerate it using the script

# California Tree Identification Guide for Kids

A comprehensive guide to help children (ages 8-10) identify trees in California through easily observable characteristics.

## Project Overview

This project creates a kid-friendly decision tree system for identifying California trees. The guide focuses on observable characteristics that children can use without specialized botanical knowledge, organizing trees into logical paths based on leaf type, season, habitat, and other visible features.

## Project Structure

### Tree Profiles (`/trees/`)
- 163 standardized YAML files containing comprehensive information on California trees
- Each file follows the format `[family-name].[common-tree-name].yml`
- Profiles include identification features, seasonal changes, kid-friendly tips, and cultural/ecological information

### Decision Trees (`/decision_trees/`)
- **broadleaf-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with flat, broad leaves
- **needle-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with needle-like leaves
- **scale-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with scale-like leaves
- **habitat-path.md** - Habitat-based identification approach
- **seasonal-path.md** - Season-specific identification techniques
- **california-tree-guide.md** - The comprehensive guide that combines all paths

### Supporting Files
- **features.yml** - Taxonomy of tree identification features with standardized IDs
- **instructions.md** - Guidelines for creating tree profile files
- **tree-tracking.md** - Tracking progress of tree profile creation

## Features

1. **Kid-Friendly Language**: All descriptions use concrete, engaging language appropriate for 8-10 year olds
2. **Observable Characteristics**: Focus on features that can be directly observed without specialized equipment
3. **Multi-Entry Points**: Different ways to approach identification based on what's visible
4. **Seasonal Adaptations**: How to identify trees in different seasons
5. **Confirmation Checkpoints**: Verification steps to ensure correct identification
6. **Visual Descriptors**: Memorable comparisons and simple analogies
7. **Safety Notes**: Clear guidance on safe interaction with trees

## Usage

The main entry point is `decision_trees/california-tree-guide.md`, which provides multiple ways to start the identification process:

1. By leaf type (broadleaf, needle, scale)
2. By observation distance (close-up vs. far away)
3. By season (spring, summer, fall, winter)
4. By habitat (coastal, riparian, mountain, urban)

Each path leads through a series of simple yes/no questions about observable characteristics until reaching a specific tree species.

## Tree Coverage

This guide includes 163 trees found in California:
- Native California trees
- Common cultivated landscape trees
- Trees from all major regions of the state
- Trees representing various leaf types, habitats, and sizes

## Educational Value

This guide helps children develop:
- Observation skills
- Logical thinking through decision trees
- Understanding of California's natural environment
- Appreciation for biodiversity
- Connection to natural spaces

## Contributing

This project is complete with all 163 tree profiles created and formatted according to the standards defined in `instructions.md`. The decision tree paths have been developed and integrated into the main guide.

# Completed Genus Update Work

## Project Overview

Successfully added genus information to all 174 tree files in the California trees collection by:

1. Extracting scientific genus from scientific name field
2. Mapping scientific genus to appropriate common genus names
3. Handling special cases and complex genus classifications
4. Updating files while preserving formatting and structure

## Final Results

- All tree files now have both `scientific_genus` and `common_genus` fields
- All "Unknown" common genus values have been replaced with accurate information
- Comprehensive mappings for all 57 genera in the collection
- Generated a detailed report of all changes in `genus_update_report.csv`

## Files Created

1. **Core Scripts:**
   - `add_genus_info.py`: Contains the extraction and mapping logic
   - `add_genus_to_all.py`: Processes all tree files and generates reports
   - `test_genus_add.py`: Testing script for validating changes

2. **Documentation:**
   - `final_summary.md`: Summary of accomplishments and implementation
   - `genus_update_report.csv`: Detailed report of all genus updates
   - `README.md`: Instructions for using the scripts

3. **Organized Directories:**
   - `scripts/genus_update/`: Contains all scripts and documentation

## Complex Mapping System

The genus mapping system handles three types of cases:

1. **Simple mappings** (e.g., "Pinus" â†’ "Pine")
2. **Complex mappings** (e.g., "Quercus" maps to "White Oak", "Live Oak", or "Black Oak" based on species)
3. **Special cases** (e.g., different types of cedars, taxonomic updates)

## Key Functions

- `extract_genus()`: Extracts the genus part from scientific name
- `get_common_genus()`: Maps scientific genus to common genus name
- `add_genus_info()`: Adds genus info to tree file while preserving structure
- `process_all_files()`: Processes all tree files and generates reports

## Testing Process

1. Initial testing on specific example files
2. Dry run mode to preview changes before applying them
3. Final run with detailed reporting
4. Verification of all 174 files including updates to "Unknown" values

## Next Steps

The genus update process is fully complete. All files have accurate genus information ready for use in tree identification, taxonomy work, and the decision tree system.

All scripts and documentation are in place for future reference.

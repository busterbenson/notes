  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves shaped like stars with pointed tips"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like a star with points, and their seeds spin down like helicopter propellers"
    touch_tip: "Feel along a branch - notice how the twigs and leaves grow directly opposite each other (not zigzagging)"
    smell_tip: "Most maples don't have a strong smell, but in fall the leaves might have a sweet, earthy scent"
    fun_fact: "If you find maple seeds ('helicopters'), toss them in the air and watch them spin down like helicopter blades!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the shape of the leaves - do they have multiple pointed lobes that make them look like a star?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a maple - check for oak if the lobes are rounded"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the branches grow - do they grow directly across from each other (opposite), not alternating sides?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a maple - maybe Sweetgum if the leaves are star-shaped but branches alternate"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seeds that come in pairs with wings (like helicopters). If it's not seed season, the opposite branching and star-shaped leaves are enough to identify it as maple!"
        yes_next: "You found a maple tree!"
        no_next: "If it's spring or summer, the tree may not have seeds yet, but it's still likely a maple if it has opposite branches and star-shaped leaves"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Many maples flower before leaves emerge; new leaves unfold with bright, fresh colors"
      reproductive_activity: "Small flowers appear, often in red or yellow clusters"
      identification_tips: "Red Maple and Silver Maple have especially showy red flowers in early spring"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, some maples look like they're covered in tiny red or yellow flowers before the leaves come out"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of green star-shaped leaves (or red/purple in some varieties)"
      reproductive_activity: "Winged seed pairs (samaras) develop and begin to mature"
      identification_tips: "Easiest to identify by the star-shaped leaves and opposite branching"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for the classic star-shaped leaves and check if the branches grow opposite each other"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Many species turn brilliant colors - reds, oranges, yellows"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pairs fully mature and begin to drop, spinning as they fall"
      identification_tips: "Fall color and spinning 'helicopter' seeds make identification easy"
      kid_friendly_tip: "This is when maples put on their best show with colorful leaves; look for the spinning 'helicopter' seeds too!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Most maples lose their leaves, showing distinctive opposite branching pattern"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; paired buds visible on branches"
      identification_tips: "Identify by opposite branching and opposite paired buds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even without leaves, you can spot maples by looking at how the branches and buds grow directly across from each other"

  look_alike_species:
    - species: "Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua)"
      differences: "Sweetgum has alternate branching (not opposite); leaves have more uniformly pointed lobes; fruits are spiky balls, not winged seeds"
      identification_tip: "Check branch arrangement - if branches alternate rather than grow opposite, it's not a maple"
    
    - species: "Sycamore (Platanus species)"
      differences: "Sycamore has alternate branching; leaves are broader with less pointed lobes; distinctive mottled bark; round, hanging seed balls"
      identification_tip: "Sycamores have distinctive patchy bark that maples lack"
    
    - species: "Oak (Quercus species)"
      differences: "Oaks have alternate branching; lobes on leaves are usually more rounded; produce acorns, not winged seeds"
      identification_tip: "If you see acorns or the lobes are rounded rather than pointed, it's likely an oak"

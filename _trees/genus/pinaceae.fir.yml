genus:
  common_name: "Fir"
  scientific_name: "Abies spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Tall, pyramid-shaped evergreen trees with short, flat, soft needles arranged singly around the twig. Firs have distinctive upright cones that disintegrate on the tree rather than falling whole, and smooth bark with resin blisters when young that develops into thick plates with age."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, soft needles growing singly (not in bundles) with distinctive round scars when removed; upright cones that disintegrate on the tree"
    secondary_markers: "Strong pyramid shape with whorled branches; needles often appear arranged in flat sprays"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Upright cones that stand like candles and fall apart on the tree"
    memorable_comparison: "Fir trees look like perfect Christmas trees with a triangle shape, and their cones stand up like birthday candles on a cake"
    touch_tip: "Touch the needles gently - they're soft and flat, not prickly like spruce, and if you try to pick one off it doesn't leave a little woody peg behind"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a sweet, fresh scent like Christmas trees"
    fun_fact: "Fir cones are special - they stand straight up like rockets ready for liftoff, and they never fall from the tree whole! Instead, they break apart scale by scale while still on the branch, letting their seeds fly away in the wind. That's why you rarely find whole fir cones on the ground."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall shape - does it have a perfect Christmas tree triangle shape with branches in clear layers (whorls)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the shape is more irregular or rounded, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles - are they flat, soft, and growing singly (not in bundles) with white lines underneath?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles grow in bundles, check pine trees; if they're sharp and square, check spruce trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Can you find any cones? Do they stand straight up on the branches or can you see their remains (they fall apart on the tree)?"
        yes_next: "You found a fir tree! The needle color and arrangement can help you figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If no cones are visible, gently pull a needle off and look at the attachment point - firs leave a round, suction-cup like scar, not a woody peg"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges at branch tips, lighter green than older needles; pollen cones may appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen release from small male cones; female cones begin developing upright on upper branches"
      identification_tips: "Look for the contrast between bright new growth and darker older needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the bright light green new growth at the tips of branches - it looks like the tree is getting fresh green finger-tips"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth darkens to match older needles; upright green or purplish cones develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones grow larger, remain upright and tightly closed"
      identification_tips: "Upright cones becoming more visible; uniform needle color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can spot the upright green or purple cones standing like candles on the upper branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Minimal color change as it remains evergreen; cones mature and begin to break apart"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and begin disintegrating, releasing seeds with papery wings"
      identification_tips: "Disintegrating cones; some needle drop from interior branches is normal"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, watch for the cones starting to break apart while still on the tree - they never fall whole!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; cone axes (central parts) may remain on branches after scales fall off"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature makes identification easier when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Firs stay green all winter, and you might see the bare 'spikes' where cones used to be before they broke apart"
      
  # Additional required sections 
  confirmation_checklist:
    - feature: "Flat, soft needles growing singly"
      reliability: "High"
      visibility: "Medium - need to look at needles up close"
    - feature: "Upright cones or evidence of disintegrated cones"
      reliability: "Very high"
      visibility: "Medium to low - cones are often high in the tree"
    - feature: "Strong pyramid shape with whorled branches"
      reliability: "High"
      visibility: "Easy to observe from distance"
    - feature: "Round leaf scars (not pegs) when needles are removed"
      reliability: "Very high"
      visibility: "Requires interaction - pulling a needle"
    
  look_alikes:
    - species: "Spruce (Picea species)"
      differences: "Spruce has sharp, square needles that are prickly to touch; when needles are pulled off, they leave woody pegs; cones hang down"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are sharp and prickly when touched, and leave little pegs when pulled off, it's a spruce, not a fir"
    
    - species: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      differences: "Not a true fir despite the name; cones hang down with distinctive 3-pronged bracts; needles leave a small peg-like projection when pulled off"
      identification_tip: "If the cones hang down and have mouse-tail-like bracts sticking out between scales, it's a Douglas-fir, not a true fir"
    
    - species: "Hemlock (Tsuga species)"
      differences: "Hemlocks have shorter needles, drooping leader (top), and tiny hanging cones; more delicate appearance"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has a drooping or nodding top and tiny cones that hang down, it's likely a hemlock"

genus:
  common_name: "Fir"
  scientific_name: "Abies spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "Tall, cone-shaped evergreen trees with flat, soft needles that grow singly on the twigs. Firs have distinctive upright cones that break apart while still on the tree, and their needles typically look as if they're arranged in flat rows on either side of the branch."

  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, soft single needles arranged to look like they're in rows on either side of the branch; upright cones that break apart on the tree rather than falling whole"
    secondary_markers: "Perfect conical shape with horizontal branches; smooth bark when young that develops resin blisters; soft needles that aren't poky"
    seasonal_markers: "No significant seasonal changes as evergreen; new growth in spring is lighter green"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike spruces, fir needles are flat (not square) and soft (not sharp); unlike pines, needles are single (not in bundles); unlike Douglas-fir, true firs have upright cones that break apart on the tree"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Soft, flat needles arranged like they're parting their hair down the middle of the branch"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like flat green combs with the needles combed neatly to each side"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel a needle - it will feel flat and soft, not sharp or poky like other evergreen trees"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle to smell a fresh, sweet Christmas tree scent (some might smell lemony!)"
    fun_fact: "Fir cones stand straight up like candles on a birthday cake and never fall off whole! Instead, they break apart scale by scale while still on the tree, leaving just a spike sticking up."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the overall shape - is it a perfect Christmas tree shape with a straight pointy top?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a fir - check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they flat and soft (not square and poky)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles are poky and roll easily between fingers, it's probably a spruce"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check how the needles are arranged. Do they look combed to the sides of the branch like a part in someone's hair?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If needles stick out all around the twig, check spruce"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If you can see any cones, do they stand straight up (not hang down) on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a fir tree!"
        no_next: "If cones hang down, it's probably spruce, Douglas-fir, or hemlock"

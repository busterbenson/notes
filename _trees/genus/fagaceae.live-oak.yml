genus:
  common_name: "Live Oak"
  scientific_name: "Quercus spp. (evergreen species)"
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Fagaceae"
  
  # Basic summary
  summary: "Evergreen oak trees with leathery, tough leaves that stay on the tree year-round. Live oaks have thick, often furrowed bark, produce acorns, and typically have rounded or spreading crowns. Unlike deciduous oaks that drop their leaves in fall, live oaks maintain green foliage throughout the year."

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that stay green all year on trees that make acorns"
    memorable_comparison: "While other oak trees drop their leaves like they're going to sleep for winter, live oaks stay awake with their green leaves all year round!"
    touch_tip: "Feel how thick and leathery the leaves are - they're tough like plastic plants, which helps them survive hot, dry summers"
    smell_tip: "Oak leaves don't have a strong smell, but if you crush an acorn it might smell a little bitter"
    fun_fact: "Live oaks can live for hundreds of years - some trees in California were already growing when your great-great-great-grandparents were born! Their roots can grow deeper than a house is tall to find water during dry summers."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's leaves. Are they still green in winter when other oak trees have lost their leaves?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a live oak - check deciduous oak species that drop their leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Does it have the typical oak leaf shape but with thick, leathery texture?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves aren't oak-shaped or are thin and papery, check other tree types"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, check for acorns. Does the tree produce acorns like other oaks?"
        yes_next: "You found a live oak! Look at leaf details to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If no acorns are found (and it's fall), check non-oak evergreen trees"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaf growth emerges, often lighter green or with more fuzzy undersides"

      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for small green baby acorns starting to grow in summer"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Minimal change as leaves remain green; may drop some older leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns mature and drop from the tree"
      identification_tips: "Look for mature acorns on the tree or fallen beneath; stands out as evergreen when deciduous trees change color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is acorn season! Look for ripe acorns falling from the tree or on the ground"
    
    - season: "Winter"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Deciduous Oaks (Black, Blue, Valley, etc.)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Deciduous oaks lose all leaves in fall/winter; often have lobed leaves rather than entire or spiny edges"

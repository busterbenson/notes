  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with pointed 'fingers' (lobes) that have tiny bristles at the tips"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like hands with fingers that each have a tiny hair at the tip"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf edges carefully - you can feel the sharp bristle tips (but they're not usually painful)"
    smell_tip: "The leaves might have a fresh, slightly bitter scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Black Oak acorns are so bitter that Native Americans had to wash them many times to remove the bitterness before eating them!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape - does it have pointed lobes with tiny bristles at the tips? Or spiny edges with bristles?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the leaf lobes are rounded without bristles, check White Oak Group instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Are the leaves shiny (glossy) on top, especially in summer?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If leaves have bristle tips but aren't shiny, it's still likely a Black Oak type"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for acorns (in fall) - do they sit in deeper cups that might cover half or more of the nut?"
        yes_next: "You've found a Black Oak!"
        no_next: "If you can't find acorns, that's okay - the bristle-tipped leaves are the most important clue"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves unfold, often with reddish tint; some species produce hanging catkins (pollen structures)"
      reproductive_activity: "Produces inconspicuous flowers; pollen released from catkins"
      identification_tips: "Young leaves already show bristle tips; reddish new growth on some species"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, new leaves might look reddish before turning green, but you can already see the bristle tips"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of mature leaves, often glossy dark green; acorns developing on some branches"
      reproductive_activity: "First-year acorns begin developing; second-year acorns continue growing"
      identification_tips: "Glossy appearance of leaves; bristle tips clearly visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the leaves are at their shiniest, like they've been polished"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Deciduous species may turn red before dropping leaves; evergreen species maintain leaves; acorns mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Second-year acorns fully mature and drop; first-year acorns persist through winter"
      identification_tips: "Mature acorns present; deciduous species may show fall color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when you can find the mature acorns under Black Oak trees"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Deciduous species lose leaves, showing branch structure; evergreen species keep their leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; first-year acorns remain small on evergreen species"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen species easily identified by leaves; deciduous by bark and branch pattern"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Most Black Oaks drop their leaves in winter (like California Black Oak), though some smaller oak shrubs (like Scrub Oak) keep some leaves year-round"

      differences: "White oaks have rounded lobes without bristle tips; typically less glossy leaves; acorns mature in one year"
      identification_tip: "If the leaf lobes are rounded without bristles, it's a white oak, not a black oak"
    
    - species: "Holly (Ilex species)"
      differences: "Holly has spiny-edged leaves that are similar to some live oaks but produces red berries, not acorns"
      identification_tip: "If you see red berries instead of acorns, it's holly not oak"
    
    - species: "Chestnut (Castanea species)"
      differences: "Chestnut has toothed leaves that are longer and narrower than oak leaves; produces spiny bur fruits, not acorns"
      identification_tip: "Chestnut leaves are more elongated with small regular teeth, not lobes with bristles"

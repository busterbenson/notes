genus:
  common_name: "Yew"
  scientific_name: "Taxus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Taxaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Evergreen trees or large shrubs with flat, dark green needles arranged in two rows along the twig. Yews produce distinctive fleshy red berry-like structures (arils) containing a single seed instead of cones, and have reddish bark that peels in thin, papery strips."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat needles arranged in two rows; bright red berry-like arils (not true berries) instead of cones; reddish, peeling bark"
    secondary_markers: "Dark green foliage; slow growth; often multi-stemmed or broadly spreading"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Flat, dark green needles with bright red berry-like structures instead of cones"
    memorable_comparison: "It's the conifer tree that makes 'berries' instead of cones - bright red berry-like cups that look like little red candies with green seeds peeking out"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and flat - not prickly like spruce or pine. But remember that the needles are poisonous, so always wash your hands after touching them!"
    smell_tip: "Crushing the needles releases a mild, resinous scent that isn't very strong"
    fun_fact: "Yew trees are like medicine factories! Scientists discovered a chemical in Pacific Yew bark called taxol, which is now used to make lifesaving cancer medicines. Yews are also some of the longest-living trees in the world - some are over 2,000 years old!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the needles - are they flat and arranged in two rows, like a feather pattern?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If needles grow all around the twig or in bundles, check other conifers"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check for cones - instead of woody cones, do you see bright red berry-like structures? (These only appear on female trees in late summer and fall)"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If you don't see red berry-like structures, check if it's the right season; they might not be visible yet"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the overall size - is it a smaller tree, often with multiple trunks or a broad, spreading habit?"
        yes_next: "You found a yew tree! Remember that all parts except the red flesh around the seed are poisonous."
        no_next: "If it's a very large tree with a single straight trunk, check other conifers"

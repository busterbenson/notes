  # Basic summary
  summary: "Aromatic evergreen trees with scale-like leaves arranged in flat, fan-like sprays. Cedars have fibrous, often reddish bark and distinctive fragrant foliage that gives off a pleasant smell when crushed. Despite their name, true cedars are actually in a different family (Pinaceae)."

  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Scale-like leaves in flat, fan-like arrangements; aromatic foliage with distinctive cedar smell when crushed; fibrous, often reddish bark"
    secondary_markers: "Small cones that vary in shape by species; pyramidal to columnar form; flattened sprays of foliage"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal changes as evergreen; new growth in spring appears brighter green"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Flat, fan-like sprays of tiny scale leaves that smell good when gently crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like flat green fans made of tiny overlapping fish scales"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the flat sprays - they're soft and not poky like pine or spruce needles"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a tiny bit of foliage to smell a nice, fresh scent like a cedar chest or pencil shavings"
    fun_fact: "The wood from these trees smells so good and lasts so long that people use it to make chests and closets that keep moths away from clothes and smell amazing for decades!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like fish scales instead of needles?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a cedar - if it has needles, check pine, fir, or spruce"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the scales are arranged. Do they form flat, fan-like sprays?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be juniper or cypress - check if scales stick out all around the twig"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a small bit of foliage and smell. Does it have a nice, pleasant cedar smell?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If no cedar smell, check other conifer options"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it reddish to reddish-brown and shredding into thin strips?"
        yes_next: "You found a cedar tree!"
        no_next: "If bark is different, check which specific cedar it might be, or if it's another tree family"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright light green new growth at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow pollen; seed cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for contrast between bright new growth and older dark green foliage"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green 'tips' on branches - like the tree is growing new fingernails!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth darkens to match older foliage; overall rich green appearance"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones develop and begin to mature"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive foliage pattern clearly visible; developing cones may be present"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the baby growth grows up to match the older parts, and small cones start growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No significant color change as it remains evergreen; cones mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and begin to open, releasing seeds"
      identification_tips: "Mature cones visible; flat sprays of scales remain green while deciduous trees change color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees turn red and yellow and lose leaves, cedars stay green with their fan-like branches"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; mature cones may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant phase; some species may retain open cones"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen foliage stands out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, cedars keep their green scales when most other trees have lost their leaves"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "True Cedars (Cedrus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "True cedars have needle-like leaves in clusters, not scales; much larger woody cones; different overall branch structure"
      identification_tip: "If it has actual needles instead of tiny scales, it's probably a true cedar or another conifer, not a cypress family cedar"
    
    - name: "Junipers (Juniperus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Junipers have scale or awl-like leaves that often grow all around the twig rather than in flat sprays; produce berry-like cone structures"
      identification_tip: "If the foliage isn't arranged in flat fans and it has berry-like blue structures instead of woody cones, it's probably a juniper"
    
    - name: "Arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Arborvitae is closely related but typically smaller; often has yellowish-green foliage; common in landscaping"
      identification_tip: "If it's a smaller tree with similar features often planted in yards and gardens, it might be arborvitae"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with a droopy top and soft, short needles arranged like feathers"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a Christmas tree that's taking a bow, with branches like delicate green feather dusters"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the needles - they're soft and flat, arranged like tiny fern leaves"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a fresh forest scent that's not very strong"
    fun_fact: "Hemlocks are forest superheroes! Unlike most big trees that need lots of sun, Western Hemlock can grow up in the dark shadows underneath other trees. And they have a funny habit - they often grow on top of fallen logs or stumps, so as the old log rots away, the hemlock tree is left standing on stilts made of its own roots!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the top of the tree. Does it droop downward instead of pointing straight up?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a hemlock - if the top points straight up, check fir or spruce"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they short (shorter than your pinky finger) and soft?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles are long or stiff and sharp, check other conifers like pine or spruce"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "For Western Hemlock: Do the needles form flat sprays like fern fronds? For Mountain Hemlock: Do the needles stick out all around the twig and look bluish-green?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If neither description matches, it might be another conifer"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the cones if you can see them. Are they very small (about the size of a grape) and hanging down?"
        yes_next: "You found a hemlock tree!"
        no_next: "If the cones are large or pointing upward, it's probably another type of tree"
  
  # Seasonal timeline

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change in foliage; cones mature to brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones open to release seeds with small wings"
      identification_tips: "Brown mature cones may be visible before dropping seeds"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Douglas-fir has longer needles, distinctive cones with three-pronged bracts, and usually a straighter top"
      identification_tip: "Hemlocks have much smaller cones without the 'mouse tail' bracts, and usually have a drooping top"
    
    - name: "Fir trees (Abies species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Firs have upright cones that break apart on the tree; non-drooping leader; needles typically all the same length"
      identification_tip: "If the cones stand upright and the top of the tree points straight up, it's probably a fir not a hemlock"
    
    - name: "Spruce trees (Picea species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Spruces have square, sharp needles that stick out all around the twig; hanging cones that are typically larger"
      identification_tip: "Try rolling a needle between your fingers - spruce needles are square and roll easily, while hemlock needles are flat"

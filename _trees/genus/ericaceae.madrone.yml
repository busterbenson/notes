  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, peeling reddish-orange bark that feels cool like plastic when you touch it"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's peeling from a sunburn, showing bright orange-red skin underneath"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - it's unusually smooth and cool, like touching plastic instead of normal tree bark"
    smell_tip: "The leaves have a faint earthy scent if you gently crush them, but not a strong smell"
    fun_fact: "Madrone bark peels off in curly strips that Native Americans sometimes used as emergency bandages! And the wood is so hard that early settlers called the tree 'ironwood' because it would quickly dull their saw blades."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's bark. Is it peeling to show smooth red-orange or cinnamon patches underneath?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a madrone - try checking for manzanita which is smaller but similar"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Touch the bark (where you can reach it safely). Does it feel unusually smooth and cool compared to other trees?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a madrone - other trees with peeling bark usually feel papery, not smooth and cool"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they thick, leathery, and glossy dark green?"
        yes_next: "You've found a madrone! If it's a big tree with smooth-edged leaves, it's Pacific Madrone. If it's smaller with toothed leaves and strawberry-like fruits, it's a Strawberry Tree."
        no_next: "Look again at the bark and leaves - madrones have distinctive peeling bark and thick evergreen leaves"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Pacific Madrone: clusters of small white bell-shaped flowers; Strawberry Tree: new leaf growth but usually no flowers"
      reproductive_activity: "Pacific Madrone: flowering and pollination; Strawberry Tree: previous year's fruits may still be present"
      identification_tips: "White flower clusters on Pacific Madrone are distinctive; both species show peeling bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, Pacific Madrone has bunches of little white flowers that look like tiny bells hanging upside-down"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Both species: bark peeling more visible in hot weather; green berries developing on Pacific Madrone"
      reproductive_activity: "Pacific Madrone: green berries developing; Strawberry Tree: developing flower buds"
      identification_tips: "Fresh peeling bark is most visible; smooth feel of bark is distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the trees 'peel their sunburn' showing bright red-orange skin underneath"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Pacific Madrone: berries ripen to bright orange-red; Strawberry Tree: white flowers appear and fruits from previous year turn red"
      reproductive_activity: "Pacific Madrone: berries fully ripen; Strawberry Tree: main flowering period and fruit ripening"
      identification_tips: "Red berries on Pacific Madrone; flowers and fruits simultaneously on Strawberry Tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Pacific Madrone has bright red berries in fall, while Strawberry Tree has both white flowers AND red fruits at the same time!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Both remain evergreen; some berries may persist; Strawberry Tree may still have some flowers"
      reproductive_activity: "Both mostly dormant; Strawberry Tree may continue flowering in mild winters"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature stands out when deciduous trees are bare; berries may persist"
      kid_friendly_tip: "When other trees lose their leaves in winter, madrones stay green and may still have some colorful berries"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Manzanita (Arctostaphylos species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Manzanitas are typically shrubs or small trees (rarely exceeding 20 feet); have smaller leaves; more crooked branching pattern"
      identification_tip: "If it's a small shrub with very twisty red branches, it's probably a manzanita, not a madrone"
    
    - name: "Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Toyon has rough bark that doesn't peel (not smooth); typically smaller; red berries in clusters similar to madrone"
      identification_tip: "If the bark is rough instead of smooth and peeling, it's likely toyon, not madrone"
    
    - name: "Chinese Photinia (Photinia serratifolia)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Photinia has similar leaves but lacks the peeling bark; bark is grayish-brown, not reddish"
      identification_tip: "If the bark doesn't peel and isn't reddish, but the leaves look similar, it might be a photinia"
    
  cultural_ecological_notes:
    - "Pacific Madrone is a key component of mixed evergreen forests in California"
    - "Both species provide important winter food for birds with their persistent berries"
    - "Pacific Madrone is fire-adapted and can resprout from the root crown after fires"
    - "Flowers provide nectar for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds"
    - "Hard, close-grained wood was historically used for tool handles and furniture"
    
  range_within_california:
    - "Pacific Madrone is native along the coastal ranges from northern to central California and in Sierra foothills"
    - "Strawberry Tree is widely planted throughout California in gardens, parks, and as street trees"
    - "Pacific Madrone prefers well-drained slopes in mixed woodlands"
    - "Strawberry Tree adapts well to various California climates and is drought-tolerant once established"
    - "Both species prefer areas with good drainage and don't do well in poorly drained soils"

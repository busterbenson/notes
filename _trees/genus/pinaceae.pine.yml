genus:
  common_name: "Pine"
  scientific_name: "Pinus spp."

  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Evergreen trees with needles grouped in bundles of 2-5, held together at the base by a small papery sheath. Pines produce woody cones with overlapping scales, and often have distinctive flaky bark that forms puzzle-like patterns on older trees."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of 2-5, joined at base by papery sheath; woody cones with overlapping scales"
    secondary_markers: "Flaking bark often in puzzle-piece pattern; branching typically in whorls around the trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as evergreen; male pollen cones release yellow pollen in spring; seed cones develop over 2-3 years"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike firs and spruces, needles grow in bundles, not singly; unlike true cedars, needles are longer and not in dense clusters on short shoots"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Needles that grow in bundles of 2-5 like little brush bunches"
    memorable_comparison: "Pine needles grow in little bunches like tiny broom bristles held together at the bottom"
    touch_tip: "Carefully feel a bundle of needles - notice how they're grouped together like a tiny paintbrush"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a few needles and smell - many pines have a clean, fresh scent like pine-scented cleaners"
    fun_fact: "Some pine trees make cones that stay tightly closed for years, waiting for a forest fire to open them! The heat from the fire melts the sticky resin holding the cone scales shut, and the seeds pop out to grow in the freshly cleared soil. It's like the tree's special fire-proof safe for its seeds!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles - do they grow in bundles of 2-5 needles held together at the base?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If needles grow singly around the twig, check spruce or fir trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Count how many needles are in each bundle - is it 2, 3, or 5? This helps figure out which pine it is"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If you can't find clear bundles, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for cones - pine cones have woody overlapping scales like layered armor"
        yes_next: "You found a pine tree! Count the needles and check the cones to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If no cones are visible, it's still likely a pine if the needles are in bundles"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears as light green 'candles' at branch tips; small pollen cones release yellow dust"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin developing after pollination"
      identification_tips: "Look for 'candles' of new growth and yellow pollen release; contrast between new and old needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green 'candles' growing at the branch tips - they're the new needle bundles growing in!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles; first-year cones continue growing"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow larger but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Consistent needle color; developing green or purple first-year cones may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new 'candles' have opened into full needle bundles, and small green baby cones might be growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Older interior needles may yellow and drop; otherwise minimal color change"
      reproductive_activity: "Second-year cones nearing maturity, changing from green to brown"
      identification_tips: "Some needle drop from interior branches is normal; look for cones at different stages"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, some of the inner, older needles might turn yellow and drop, but the tree stays mostly green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; mature cones may open and release seeds or stay on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones may release seeds during dry periods"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature makes identification easier when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Pines stay green all winter, and their cones often stay on the branches where you can see them easily"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "Evergreen trees with needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of 2, 3, or 5, wrapped together at the base. Pines have distinctive woody cones with overlapping scales, and most have scaly or plated bark. They're found throughout California in many different habitats, from coastal areas to high mountains."

  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles growing in bundles of 2, 3, or 5 (not single needles); woody cones with overlapping scales"
    secondary_markers: "Evergreen trees with generally straight trunks; resinous wood and needles; flaky or plated bark patterns"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as evergreen; male pollen cones shed yellow pollen in spring; woody cones mature over 2-3 years"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike spruces and firs, needles grow in bundles, not singly; unlike cedars, have needle-like leaves, not scale-like leaves; cone shape and needle count differentiates between pine species"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Needles that grow in bundles of 2, 3, or 5 from the same point on the branch"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles look like bunches of long green straws or spaghetti tied together at the bottom"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel a bundle of needles - notice how they're all attached at the base in a little papery wrapper"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a fresh, piney Christmas tree scent"
    fun_fact: "Pine trees make two completely different kinds of cones! The small, papery ones that release yellow pollen, and the big woody ones that hold the seeds. Only the woody ones are what most people think of as 'pinecones'!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if the tree has needles instead of broad leaves or tiny scales"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a pine - if it has broad leaves, check deciduous trees; if it has tiny scales, check cedar or cypress"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the needles grow. Do they come in bundles where multiple needles (2, 3, or 5) are attached at the same point?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a pine - if needles grow singly, check fir, spruce, or hemlock"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Count the needles in a bundle. Are there 2, 3, or 5 needles in each group?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Unusual number - double-check your count or look at a different bundle"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the cones if you can see them. Are they woody with overlapping scales (not berry-like or with wing-like parts)?"
        yes_next: "You found a pine tree! Count the needles to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If cones are very different, check other conifer types"
  
  # Seasonal timeline
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears; male cones release yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones shed pollen; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth at branch tips and yellow pollen"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, pine trees make baby needles and lots of yellow dust (pollen) that can cover cars and puddles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth hardens; first-year cones grow larger"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones continue developing"
      identification_tips: "New and old needle growth visible; developing green cones may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown bigger and small green pinecones are growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles yellow and drop; second-year cones mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones open to release seeds with wings"
      identification_tips: "Look for open or opening mature cones and some needle drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the older needles turn yellow and drop, while the pinecones open up to let their seeds fly away"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree remains green; some empty cones may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive silhouette and needle bundles visible year-round"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, pines stay green and you can still identify them by their needle bundles"

    - name: "Spruce trees (Picea species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Spruces have single, sharp needles that grow on small peg-like projections all around the twig; hanging cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with rounded 'fingers' (lobes) and no pointy tips"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like a hand with round, stubby fingers - no sharp points"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels rough and deeply cracked on big trees, like deep canyons in tree skin"
    smell_tip: "The leaves may have a fresh, slightly bitter scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "White Oak acorns are less bitter than Black Oak acorns, which is why many animals (and Native Americans) preferred them for food!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape - does it have rounded lobes (like a hand with rounded fingers) instead of pointed tips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the leaf lobes have bristle tips, check Black Oak Group instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for acorns (in fall) - do they have a shallow cup that covers less than half the nut?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If no acorns are visible, but leaves have rounded lobes, it's still likely a White Oak"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the bark - on larger trees, is it thick and deeply furrowed (with deep cracks and ridges)?"
        yes_next: "You've found a White Oak!"
        no_next: "If bark is smooth or corky, it could be a young White Oak or Cork Oak"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves unfold, often with light green or reddish tint; some species produce hanging catkins (pollen structures)"
      reproductive_activity: "Produces inconspicuous flowers; pollen released from catkins"
      identification_tips: "Young leaves and catkins visible; leaf shape already shows rounded lobes"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the fresh green leaves just starting to form their rounded 'fingers'"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of mature leaves; acorns begin developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns grow throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Mature leaf shape clearly visible; developing acorns may be seen"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is a great time to see the full shape of the rounded leaf lobes"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Deciduous species turn yellow-brown; acorns mature and drop; evergreen species maintain leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Acorns fully mature and fall from tree"
      identification_tips: "Presence of mature acorns; deciduous species begin dropping leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is acorn season! Look for acorns on the ground or still on the tree"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Deciduous species lose leaves, showing branch structure; evergreen species keep leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Deciduous species identified by branch pattern and bark; evergreen species by leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Some White Oaks lose their leaves in winter, while others keep them - look at the bark and branches on the bare ones"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Black Oak Group (Quercus species, black oak section)"
      differences: "Black oaks have bristle tips at the ends of leaf lobes; typically more glossy leaves; acorns mature in two years"
      identification_tip: "If the leaf lobes end in tiny bristles or hair-like points, it's a black oak, not a white oak"
    
    - species: "Maple (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maples have opposite branching (not alternate); typically more pointed lobes; produce winged helicopter seeds (not acorns)"
      identification_tip: "Check how the branches grow - if directly opposite each other, it's maple not oak"
    
    - species: "Sycamore (Platanus species)"
      differences: "Sycamores have distinctive mottled, peeling bark; larger leaves; round ball-shaped fruits (not acorns)"
      identification_tip: "If the bark has a camouflage pattern of multiple colors, it's sycamore not oak"

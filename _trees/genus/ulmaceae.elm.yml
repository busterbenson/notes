genus:
  common_name: "Elm"
  scientific_name: "Ulmus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Ulmaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees with distinctive asymmetrical leaves that have double-toothed edges and prominent veins. Elms produce papery, winged seeds that mature in spring before leaf-out, and typically develop a vase-shaped or umbrella-like crown with arching branches."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with uneven bases and edges that look like tiny saw teeth"
    memorable_comparison: "Elm leaves look like they slid off-center - one side of the base is lower than the other, like the leaf is wearing its hat crooked"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - many elms have leaves that feel a bit like sandpaper on the top side"
    smell_tip: "Elm leaves don't have a strong smell, but they might have a faint fresh, green scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Elm trees used to line many streets in America, creating beautiful green tunnels, but a disease called Dutch elm disease killed many of them. The good news is that scientists are working on breeding elms that can resist the disease, and some like Chinese elm naturally fight it off!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - do they have uneven bases, where one side of the leaf connects lower than the other side?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the leaf base is even on both sides, it's probably not an elm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaf edges - do they have tiny double teeth, like a saw with little teeth on top of bigger teeth?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the edges are smooth or have simple teeth, it's likely not an elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In spring, look for papery winged seeds that look like tiny round pancakes; in other seasons, does the tree have a vase shape or rounded crown?"
        yes_next: "You found an elm! The leaf size and bark can help you figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If the shape is very different and you don't see the seeds, check other deciduous trees"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Flowers and fruits appear before or with new leaves; winged seeds mature and drop; new leaves emerge"
      reproductive_activity: "Small reddish-green flowers appear; quickly develop into papery winged seeds"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive seeds are highly visible in early spring, often before leaves appear"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, elm trees make lots of little flat, round, papery seeds that twirl like helicopters when they fall"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of green leaves; distinctive tree shape visible"
      reproductive_activity: "No reproductive activity; seed production complete"
      identification_tips: "Asymmetrical leaf bases and double-toothed edges clearly visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you can easily see the elm's crooked-based leaves and how they're arranged along the branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves typically turn yellow before dropping; distinctive crown shape becomes more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Begins developing flower buds for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color; increasingly visible branch structure"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, elm leaves turn yellow (not red or orange like maple leaves) before they drop to the ground"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal zigzag pattern of twigs; pointed reddish buds"
      reproductive_activity: "Flower buds continue developing; will open in early spring"
      identification_tips: "Vase-shaped crown or rounded outline visible; distinctive zigzag twigs with pointed buds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter when the leaves are gone, you can see how elm twigs grow in a zigzag pattern, not straight lines"

      differences: "Beech has symmetrical leaf bases; smoother bark; different fruits (nuts in spiny husks); distinctive winter buds"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves have even bases and the bark is smooth and gray, it's likely a beech tree"
    
    - species: "Zelkova (Zelkova species)"
      differences: "Zelkova has similar leaves but with more evenly serrated edges and more symmetrical bases; different growth habit with branches often starting higher on trunk"

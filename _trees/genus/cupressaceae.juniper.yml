  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue 'berries' and leaves that smell spicy when crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "The blue 'berries' look like tiny blueberries growing on the branches, and the tree smells like a Christmas wreath when you crush the leaves"
    touch_tip: "The scale-like leaves feel soft when you stroke them one way, but prickly when you stroke them the other way"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a few leaves between your fingers to smell the strong, spicy scent - like the smell of a cleaning product but natural!"
    fun_fact: "The blue 'berries' aren't really berries at all - they're special cones where the scales grew together to look like berries! Birds love to eat them, and people use juniper berries to flavor gin, which is a grown-up drink."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at where the tree is growing - is it in a dry, sunny, possibly rocky spot?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Junipers prefer dry places, so if it's in a wet area, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they tiny scales (like fish scales) that cover the twigs, or very short needles?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles are long or in bundles, it's probably a different evergreen"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently crush a few leaves and smell them - do they have a strong, spicy scent?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If there's no strong smell, check cypress or cedar trees"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for blue berry-like cones on the branches (they might be small) - can you find any?"
        yes_next: "You found a juniper! Check the bark and shape to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If no berries are visible, it may be a juniper not in fruiting season, or a cypress - check the smell again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Some new growth emerges, often with a lighter green color; pollen may be released from male cones"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Pollen release may create yellow dusty appearance on some trees; look for contrast between old and new growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, some junipers release yellow pollen that might make you sneeze if you stand too close!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Foliage reaches full development; young green berry-like cones becoming visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones continue developing, appearing as small green 'berries'"
      identification_tips: "Look for green, unripe berry-like cones; drought-tolerant appearance stands out in dry summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "During summer, look for small green 'berries' starting to form - they're baby juniper cones!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Berry-like cones mature, turning from green to blue, purple, or reddish"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones fully ripen but may remain on tree through winter"
      identification_tips: "Blue ripe 'berries' are highly distinctive; no fall color change as it's evergreen"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when the juniper 'berries' turn blue, like tiny blueberries on the branches"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; ripe berries may persist on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; some berries may remain from previous year"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature and persistent berries make winter identification easy"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, junipers stay green when many trees lose their leaves, and birds like to eat the berries when other food is hard to find"

      differences: "Cypress has similar scale-like leaves but produces woody cones, not berry-like cones; different aroma when crushed"
      identification_tip: "If it has woody cones instead of 'berries', it's a cypress, not a juniper"
    
    - species: "Incense Cedar (Calocedrus decurrens)"
      differences: "Incense Cedar has flat sprays of scale-like leaves; woody duck-bill shaped cones; different aroma"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves grow in flat fan-like patterns and it has woody cones, it's cedar, not juniper"
    
    - species: "Arborvitae/Thuja (Thuja species)"
      differences: "Arborvitae has flattened fan-like sprays of scales; different aroma; small woody cones"

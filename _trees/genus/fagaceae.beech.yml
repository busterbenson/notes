  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, elephant-skin gray bark and oval leaves with strong parallel lines"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like smooth elephant skin, and the leaves have strong parallel lines like the lines on notebook paper"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - it's smooth and cool to the touch, and doesn't flake or peel like many other trees"
    smell_tip: "Beech leaves have a mild, fresh scent when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Beech trees are like elephant trees - they have smooth gray bark that looks like elephant skin, and they never forget winter! Young beech trees hold onto their dead leaves all winter long (like they forget to drop them), making them easy to spot in the winter forest. People long ago used beech wood to make the first books - in fact, the word 'book' comes from an old word for 'beech'!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth and gray, like elephant skin, without deep grooves or peeling layers?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, deeply grooved, or peeling, it's probably not a beech"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves - are they simple (not divided into leaflets) with small teeth around the edges and strong parallel lines (veins)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves don't have parallel veins and small teeth, or if they're divided into leaflets, it's likely not a beech"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall or winter, look for small spiny husks that contain triangular nuts, or in winter, check for the slim, pointed cigar-shaped buds"
        yes_next: "You found a beech tree! If it has purple leaves, it's a special cultivated variety of European Beech."
        no_next: "If you don't see these features, check other deciduous trees with smooth bark"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge as light, bright green from long, pointed buds; small inconspicuous flowers appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Separate male and female flowers on same tree; male flowers in hanging clusters, female flowers in pairs"
      identification_tips: "Fresh light green leaves with crisp edges; pleated appearance when first emerging"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, beech trees unfold bright green leaves that look accordion-pleated, like they were just unfolded from a tiny package"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves darken to deep green (or remain purple in purple varieties); developing nuts may be visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Nuts continue developing inside growing spiny husks"
      identification_tips: "Glossy, fully-developed leaves with distinct parallel veins; smooth gray bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, beech leaves turn deep green and feel smooth and papery, and you might spot the developing spiny seed husks"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn golden-brown, copper, or light tan before dropping; nuts mature and fall"
      reproductive_activity: "Spiny husks open to release triangular nuts"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive fall color; open spiny husks; triangular nuts on ground beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, beech leaves turn golden-brown or copper, and the spiny seed cases open to drop triangular nuts that look like little pyramids"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Smooth gray bark prominent; young trees often retain dead tan leaves; distinctive slim pointed buds"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Marcescent leaves (retained dead leaves); distinctive slim, pointed buds; smooth gray bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, young beech trees often keep their dead leaves, and all beeches have pointy buds that look like little brown cigars"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Hornbeam (Carpinus species)"
      differences: "Hornbeams have similar leaves but more deeply toothed; bark is smooth but more muscled or ridged; fruits are not in spiny husks"
      identification_tip: "If the bark has muscle-like ridges rather than being perfectly smooth, and the fruits hang in hop-like clusters rather than spiny husks, it's likely a hornbeam"
    
    - species: "Birch (Betula species)"
      differences: "Birches have more triangular leaves, often with doubly-serrated margins; bark usually peels or has lenticels; catkin fruits instead of nuts"
      identification_tip: "If the bark is white, peeling, or has horizontal lines, and the leaves are more triangular than oval, it's likely a birch"
    
    - species: "Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus)"
      differences: "Tanoak (included in this guide but not a true beech) develops scaly bark with age; has evergreen leaves; produces acorn-like nuts; native to California"
      identification_tip: "If it keeps its leaves all year and has acorn-like nuts, it's tanoak, which is related to oaks despite some beech-like features"

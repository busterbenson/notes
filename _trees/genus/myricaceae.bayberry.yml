genus:
  common_name: "Bayberry"
  scientific_name: "Morella spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Myricaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Evergreen shrubs or small trees with leathery, aromatic leaves covered in tiny resin dots that release a pleasant fragrance when crushed. Bayberries have distinctive waxy blue-gray berries that cluster directly on the stems, and the leaves are typically wedge-shaped, widening toward the tip."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with tiny resin dots and waxy blue-gray berries"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves have tiny golden dots like freckles, and the berries look like they're covered with blue-gray candle wax. The leaves smell nice when you rub them."
    touch_tip: "Gently crush a leaf between your fingers and smell the pleasant, spicy fragrance"
    smell_tip: "The crushed leaves have a pleasant spicy or balsamic scent, not as strong as bay laurel"
    fun_fact: "The waxy coating on bayberry fruits was once collected to make fragrant candles! People would boil the berries to extract the wax that floats to the top, then skim it off to make special candles that smelled wonderful when burned. It takes about 15 pounds of berries to make just 1 pound of wax, so these candles were very special. The plants are also great for wildlife because birds love the berries, and the thick evergreen growth makes perfect hiding places."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they leathery and wedge-shaped (wider at the tip than the base)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If leaves are a different shape or texture, it's probably not a bayberry"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Hold a leaf up to the light or use a magnifying glass - can you see tiny dots on the leaf surface?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If there are no visible dots on the leaves, it's likely not a bayberry"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for waxy blue-gray berries growing directly on the stems (in late summer through winter)"
        yes_next: "You found a bayberry! If it's growing wild near the California coast, it's likely Pacific Bayberry."
        no_next: "If it's not berry season, gently crush a leaf and smell - bayberry has a pleasant spicy fragrance"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that 'dance' or tremble in the slightest breeze"

    fun_fact: "Aspen trees can grow connected by their roots, so what looks like a forest of trees might actually be one single organism!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they round or heart-shaped, and do they tremble or 'dance' in even the slightest breeze?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If leaves are triangular and don't tremble much, check Poplar or Birch instead"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the bark - is it smooth and greenish-white to cream colored with dark marks (not peeling in papery layers)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If bark peels in papery layers, check Birch instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are there several similar trees growing together in a group (especially in mountain areas)?"
        yes_next: "You've found an Aspen grove!"
        no_next: "If it's a single tree but has trembling round leaves and smooth white bark, it's still likely an Aspen"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Birch (Betula species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Birches have similar light-colored bark but it peels in papery layers; leaves are more triangular and don't quiver as noticeably"
      identification_tip: "If the bark peels in paper-like strips, it's birch not aspen"
    
    - name: "Poplar (other Populus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Other poplars have larger, more triangular leaves; bark often darker and more furrowed; typically larger trees"
      identification_tip: "Poplar leaves are usually more pointed and triangular, less round than aspen"
    
    - name: "Cottonwood (Populus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Cottonwoods are in the same genus but have larger, more triangular leaves; bark becomes deeply furrowed with age"
      identification_tip: "Cottonwoods typically grow much larger than aspens and often near water in valleys rather than mountains"

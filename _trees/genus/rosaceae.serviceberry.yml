  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Early spring white flower clusters and smooth gray bark with summer blueberry-like fruits"
    memorable_comparison: "It's like a tree that can't decide if it wants to be a blueberry bush or a cherry tree - it has little white flowers like cherry but makes small blue berries!"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth gray bark - it's cool to the touch and has subtle stripes as it grows"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light, sweet fragrance in spring"
    fun_fact: "Serviceberry has lots of fun nicknames like 'Juneberry' (because its berries ripen in June), 'Shadbush' (because it blooms when shad fish swim upstream to spawn), and even 'Saskatoon' in Canada. The berries are not only safe to eat but super tasty and nutritious - they taste like a mix of blueberry, cherry, and almond. Many birds, bears, and people love to collect them!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Check when it flowers - does it have clusters of small white flowers very early in spring, often before other trees leaf out?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it flowers later in spring or has different colored flowers, it might be another tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth and gray, sometimes with subtle stripes?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, deeply furrowed, or peeling, it's likely not a serviceberry"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check for fruits in summer - are they small, round, and purple-blue like little blueberries (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch across)?"
        yes_next: "You found a serviceberry! These berries are safe to eat and delicious when fully ripe."
        no_next: "If the fruits are red, large, or a different shape, check other trees"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full leaf development; green berries develop and ripen to red, then blue-purple"
      reproductive_activity: "Berries mature; eaten and dispersed by birds and mammals"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive blue-purple berries resembling blueberries; fine-toothed oval leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the flowers turn into small fruits that change from green to red to blue-purple, and they're safe to taste when fully ripe!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow, orange, or red before dropping"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; most berries consumed by wildlife"
      identification_tips: "Attractive fall color; smooth gray bark becomes more visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, serviceberry leaves turn beautiful colors like orange and red, similar to flames"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal smooth gray bark often with subtle striping; slender buds visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds developing for early spring bloom"
      identification_tips: "Smooth gray bark; slender pointed buds; often multi-stemmed growth habit"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can see the smooth gray bark, and if you look closely, there are tiny buds ready to burst into flowers at the first sign of spring"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "Conical evergreen trees with stiff, sharp needles that grow singly (not in bundles) around the entire twig. Spruce trees have distinctive hanging cones and needles that are square in cross-section, which makes them roll easily between your fingers."

  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Sharp, stiff needles growing singly (not in bundles) around the twig; needles square in cross-section and roll easily between fingers; hanging cones that fall intact"
    secondary_markers: "Conical shape with horizontal branches; rough bark with small, thin scales; small woody projections (sterigmata) left on twigs when needles fall"
    seasonal_markers: "No significant seasonal changes as evergreen; pollen cones in spring; seed cones develop through summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike firs, spruce needles are sharp (not soft), grow on small peg-like projections, and leave rough projections on the twig when removed; unlike pines, needles are single (not in bundles)"

    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the overall shape - is it a perfect Christmas tree shape with a straight pointy top?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a spruce - check other conifer options"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the needles grow. Do they stick out all around the twigs (not in bundles or flat rows)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles are in bundles, it's a pine; if in flat rows, check fir or hemlock"

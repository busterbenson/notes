  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Cones with little 'mouse tails' sticking out between the scales"
    memorable_comparison: "The cones look like they have tiny mice trying to hide inside, with just their tails sticking out!"
    touch_tip: "Touch the needles - they're soft and flat, not prickly like spruce trees"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to smell a sweet citrus scent, like lemons and oranges mixed together"
    fun_fact: "Douglas-firs aren't true firs at all! They're named after David Douglas who brought the seeds to Europe, but scientists gave them their own special group. Some Coast Douglas-firs can grow taller than a 30-story building!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the needles - are they flat, soft, and growing all around the twig (not in bundles)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If needles are in bundles, check pine trees; if they're sharp and square, check spruce trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Can you find any cones? Do they hang down with little three-pointed 'tails' sticking out between the scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If cones stand upright without bracts, check true fir trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape - does it have a pyramid form like a Christmas tree?"
        yes_next: "You found a Douglas-fir! Check which kind by looking at the needle color and where it's growing."
        no_next: "Most Douglas-firs have pyramid shapes; if the tree is very old or has an unusual shape, check the cones again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright new growth appears at branch tips, lighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen is released from small male cones; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for the contrast between new bright green growth and darker older needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the bright green 'new growth' at the ends of branches - it looks like the tree is getting a fresh haircut!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Needles reach mature color; new cones continue developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones grow throughout summer, still green and closed"
      identification_tips: "Consistent needle color; developing green cones may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you can see the baby cones growing - they're green and about the size of your thumb"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No needle color change as it remains evergreen; cones mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones turn brown, open, and release seeds with papery wings"
      identification_tips: "Brown open cones with visible bracts; no needle color change"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when the cones turn brown and open up to let the seeds fly out - look for the little 'mouse tails' sticking out between the cone scales!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; may hold some opened cones through winter"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature makes it stand out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, Douglas-firs stay green when many other trees lose their leaves"
      
  # Additional required sections 
  confirmation_checklist:
    - feature: "Soft, flat needles growing singly around the twig"
      reliability: "High"
      visibility: "Medium - need to see needles up close"
    - feature: "Distinctive cones with three-pronged bracts"
      reliability: "Very high"
      visibility: "Medium - need to find cones, which may be high in the tree"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "True Firs (Abies species)"
      differences: "True firs have upright cones without visible bracts; needle attachment leaves a round scar, not a peg"
      identification_tip: "If cones stand upright and don't have 'mouse tails', it's a true fir"
    
    - species: "Spruce (Picea species)"
      differences: "Spruce has sharp, square needles that prickle when touched; cones don't have three-pronged bracts"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are sharp and prickly when you touch them, it's likely a spruce, not a Douglas-fir"
    
    - species: "Hemlock (Tsuga species)"
      differences: "Hemlock has much smaller cones without bracts; shorter needles with a distinctive feathery appearance"
      identification_tip: "Hemlocks have droopy tops and flatter needle arrangement; much smaller cones than Douglas-fir"
    
  cultural_ecological_notes:
    - "Douglas-fir is one of the most economically important timber trees in North America"
    - "Native American tribes used the wood for tools, structures, and fuel"
    - "The sweet-smelling pitch was used medicinally for colds and sore throats"
    - "Provides important habitat for spotted owls, flying squirrels, and other wildlife"
    - "Seeds are an important food source for many birds and small mammals"
    
  range_within_california:
    - "Coast Douglas-fir grows along the coast and in the northern mountains"
    - "Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir found in drier eastern mountains"
    - "Bigcone Douglas-fir limited to mountains of southern California"
    - "Generally found at elevations from sea level to 5,500 feet (Coast) or higher for other varieties"

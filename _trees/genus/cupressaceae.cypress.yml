  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense, overlapping sprays; rounded woody cones; strong, pleasant scent when foliage is crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Various growth forms depending on species (columnar, pyramidal, or spreading); gray-green to blue-gray foliage; bark that becomes furrowed or shreddy with age"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays evergreen year-round with minimal seasonal changes; pollen cones release yellow pollen in late winter/early spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Trees with tiny scale-like leaves that form dense sprays, often with distinctive shapes (pencil-thin columns, Christmas tree shapes, or wind-blown forms)"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves feel like tiny overlapping fish scales, and the tree forms can range from skinny soldiers standing at attention (Italian Cypress) to trees that look like they're being blown sideways by the wind (Monterey Cypress)"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the sprays of leaves - they're soft and flat, not prickly like many evergreen trees"
    smell_tip: "Rub a small bit of foliage between your fingers to smell a fresh, spicy scent like cleaning supplies or cedar chests"
    fun_fact: "Cypress trees can live for hundreds of years! Some Italian Cypress trees in Europe are over 1,000 years old - older than most castles!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's leaves. Are they tiny scales that overlap like fish scales rather than needles or flat leaves?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a cypress - check if it has needles or broader leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently rub some leaves and smell your fingers. Do they have a strong, fresh, spicy smell?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another scale-leaved tree like juniper or cedar - check for other identifying features"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape. Is it super skinny like a pencil, pyramid-shaped like a Christmas tree, or wide and wind-blown looking?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Could be another member of the cypress family - look for cones to confirm"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If you can find any cones, check if they're round and woody rather than berry-like or elongated."
        yes_next: "You found a cypress tree! Look at the shape and color to determine which kind."
        no_next: "If the tree has berries instead of woody cones, it might be a juniper; if it has elongated cones, it could be a cedar"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears as slightly brighter green at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Yellow pollen cones may be visible; some yellow pollen dust may appear on surfaces beneath trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, tiny yellow pollen cones might cover the tree and make yellow dust when you shake a branch (but don't breathe it in!)"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Foliage matures to consistent color (green to blue-gray depending on species); young cones grow larger"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones continue developing, turning from green to brown"
      identification_tips: "Young green cones become visible as they develop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for baby cones that start green and slowly turn woody and brown like tiny round pinecones"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen; mature cones become woody"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature but typically remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Mature cones turn brown and woody, with raised scales"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Unlike many trees, cypress stays the same color in fall - no reds or yellows, just the same green all year long"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "New pollen cones form for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive silhouette stands out when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, cypress trees still keep their 'clothes' on while other trees lose their leaves"

genus:
  common_name: "Eucalyptus"
  scientific_name: "Eucalyptus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Myrtaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Tall evergreen trees with aromatic leaves that contain fragrant oils and distinctive smooth bark that peels in long strips or patches. Eucalyptus trees have unusual flowers with a cap (operculum) that pops off to reveal fluffy stamens, and they produce woody seed capsules with geometric patterns."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Aromatic leaves with oil glands; smooth multicolored bark that peels; distinctive rounded seed capsules with geometric patterns"
    secondary_markers: "Adult leaves often sickle-shaped and hanging vertically; juvenile leaves often different in shape and arrangement; strong menthol or camphor scent when leaves are crushed"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Peeling colorful bark and leaves that smell like cough drops"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark peels like sunburned skin, and the leaves smell like cough drops or chest rub when you crush them"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth bark and watch how it peels away in strips; crush a leaf gently to smell the strong medicine-like scent"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf between your fingers and smell the strong menthol or camphor scent - it's like natural cough drops!"
    fun_fact: "Eucalyptus trees were brought to California from Australia over 150 years ago because people thought they would make good lumber. They grew super fast, but the wood often twisted as it dried! Koalas in Australia eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves, but the leaves are actually poisonous to most other animals. The trees have special oil in their leaves that makes them smell like medicine - in fact, some cough drops are made with eucalyptus oil!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth with peeling patches in different colors?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, deeply furrowed, or not peeling, it's probably not a eucalyptus"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully pick a leaf, crush it gently, and smell it - does it have a strong medicine-like smell (like cough drops)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaf doesn't have a strong aromatic smell, it's likely not a eucalyptus"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seed capsules - are they woody, cup-shaped or ball-shaped with a geometric pattern?"
        yes_next: "You found a eucalyptus tree! The leaf shape can help you figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If you can't find seed capsules, check other features like leaf shape and arrangement"

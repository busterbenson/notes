  # Basic summary
  summary: "Tall evergreen trees with smooth, peeling bark and strongly aromatic leaves that smell like menthol or medicine. Eucalyptus trees have distinctive juvenile and adult leaves that look different from each other, produce fluffy white flowers, and form woody seed capsules. They're native to Australia but widely planted in California."

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Peeling, colorful bark and strong medicine-like smell from leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like it's peeling off like sunburned skin, showing rainbow colors underneath"
    touch_tip: "Feel how smooth the bark is where it has recently peeled, and notice how the leaves feel waxy"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf between your fingers and smell - it's like cough drops, or sometimes lemons!"
    fun_fact: "Koalas in Australia eat only eucalyptus leaves, but they'd get sick eating California eucalyptus because our trees grow differently! And these trees can grow taller than a 15-story building!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth and peeling off in strips showing different colors underneath?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be eucalyptus - check other tree options"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully pick one leaf (don't take too many) and gently crush it between your fingers. Does it smell strongly like medicine or cough drops?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it doesn't have a strong medicine smell, check California Bay Laurel (which smells spicy) or other aromatic trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seed pods on the tree or ground. Are they hard, woody cups with a flat or slightly domed top?"
        yes_next: "You found a eucalyptus tree!"
        no_next: "If the seed pods look very different, it might be another type of tree"

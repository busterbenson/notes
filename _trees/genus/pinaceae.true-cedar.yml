genus:
  common_name: "True Cedar"
  scientific_name: "Cedrus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Majestic evergreen trees with short, stiff needles arranged in dense spiral clusters on short spur branches. True cedars have distinctive large, barrel-shaped upright cones that mature over 2-3 years and disintegrate on the tree, and they typically develop a pyramidal shape when young that becomes flat-topped or irregular with age."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in dense clusters on short spur branches; large, upright barrel-shaped cones; pyramidal shape when young, often becoming flat-topped with age"
    secondary_markers: "Branches typically in distinct horizontal layers; large cones that remain upright and disintegrate on the tree"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as evergreen; pollen release in fall; cones develop over 2-3 years"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike pines, needles are in clusters on short spur branches rather than in bundles with a sheath; unlike firs, has clusters of needles and upright cones that don't disintegrate completely; unlike spruces, has clustered not singular needles"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Short needles growing in little brush-like clusters; large upright barrel-shaped cones"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles grow in little tufts like tiny green bottle brushes, and the cones stand upright like wooden barrels or eggs"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel a cluster of needles - notice how they're grouped tightly together like a little brush"
    smell_tip: "True cedars have a pleasant, mild resinous scent if you gently crush a few needles"
    fun_fact: "True cedars are some of the most ancient trees mentioned in human history! The famous Cedars of Lebanon were used to build King Solomon's temple thousands of years ago, and they're mentioned many times in the Bible and ancient stories. These trees can live for over 1,000 years, and some of the oldest ones have trunks so big that it would take 5 or 6 kids holding hands to reach around them!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at how the needles grow - are they in dense clusters or tufts along the branches, like little green bottle brushes?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If needles grow singly or in bundles with a papery base, check other conifer trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for cones - are they large, wooden, barrel-shaped and standing upright on the branches (not hanging down)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If cones hang down or have a different shape, it's likely another type of conifer"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the overall shape - is it pyramidal when young, or with horizontal branches that might form layers or have drooping tips?"
        yes_next: "You found a true cedar! The branch form can help you figure out which kind - drooping tips mean Deodar Cedar, blue-gray means Atlas Cedar, and a flat top when older suggests Lebanon Cedar."
        no_next: "If the shape is very different, check other evergreen trees"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges as light green at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "No significant reproductive activity; cones continue developing from previous year"
      identification_tips: "Fresh light green growth at branch tips contrasts with older, darker needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright light green new needle clusters growing at the branch tips, standing out against the darker old needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older foliage; developing cones visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to develop and grow throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive needle clusters; developing upright cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have darkened to match the older ones, and you might see green young cones standing up like little barrels"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Minimal color change; pollen cones may appear on male trees"
      reproductive_activity: "Male trees release yellow pollen from small cones; female cones continue developing"
      identification_tips: "Yellow pollen release may be visible; upright seed cones at various stages"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, male cedar trees make lots of yellow pollen that can create golden clouds when the wind blows"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; mature cones may begin to disintegrate"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones begin to break apart while still attached to the tree"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature with distinctive needle clusters visible year-round"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Cedars stay green all winter, and their big barrel-shaped cones start to fall apart while still on the branches, letting seeds fly away"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Incense Cedar (Calocedrus decurrens)"
      differences: "Incense cedar has scale-like leaves, not needle clusters; different cone shape; strong fragrance when crushed"
      identification_tip: "If the foliage is flat, scale-like sprays (not needle clusters) and has a strong incense smell when crushed, it's an incense cedar, not a true cedar"
    
    - species: "Pine (Pinus species)"
      differences: "Pines have needles in bundles of 2-5 with a papery sheath at the base; cones hang down or point outward"
      identification_tip: "If the needles grow in bundles with a papery wrapper at their base, it's a pine, not a cedar"
    
    - species: "Fir (Abies species)"
      differences: "Firs have single flat needles, not clusters; different cone structure that disintegrates completely on the tree"
      identification_tip: "If needles grow singly (not in clusters) and leave flat circular scars when removed, it's a fir, not a cedar"

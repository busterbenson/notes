# Cosmologies from Interview-2

This document contains descriptions of all cosmologies from the interview-2.md file.

## Flat Earth Perspectives

### Biblical Flat Earth
You believe the Bible or religious texts describe Earth differently than the globe model. You see this as divine revelation that should take precedence over scientific claims that contradict scripture.

### Conspiratorial Flat Earth
You think powerful organizations are hiding the truth about Earth's flat nature. This deception serves various agendas—from maintaining authority over cosmological understanding to hiding additional land beyond Antarctica.

### Experiential Flat Earth
You trust what you can see and experience yourself. In your daily observation, the Earth appears flat, water finds its level, and the horizon rises to eye level regardless of altitude.

## Simulation Perspectives

### Technological Simulation
You believe our reality is like an advanced computer program created by a technologically advanced civilization. This is a scientific/technological hypothesis about how the universe works.

### Divine Simulation
You believe our reality was created by something like a god or gods, making this perspective similar to religious views but framed in technological terms.

### Nested Realities
You believe we exist in just one layer of many nested realities, with simulators themselves being simulated. Reality consists of worlds within worlds.

### Conscious Simulation
You believe our reality is more like a shared dream than a computer program. Reality emerges from consciousness rather than from code.

## Multiverse Perspectives

### Quantum Many-Worlds
You believe every choice creates a new universe where different possibilities play out. Reality continually branches into parallel versions, creating countless timelines.

### Cosmic Bubble Universes
You believe different universes exist like bubbles, each with their own physical laws. These are like multiple soap bubbles forming in cosmic foam.

### Higher-Dimensional Branes
You believe universes exist in higher dimensions, like pages in a book. Our universe exists on a membrane in higher-dimensional space.

### Cyclical Universe
You believe the universe cycles through big bangs and big crunches, creating new universes with each cycle.

## Extraterrestrial Influence

### Intervention Origins
You believe extraterrestrial beings played a role in human origins or evolution, possibly explaining the "missing link" and humanity's rapid cognitive development.

### Technological Guidance
You believe extraterrestrials gave advanced knowledge or technology to ancient civilizations, explaining achievements like megalithic structures or astronomical knowledge.

### Religious Foundations
You believe religious traditions began from encounters with extraterrestrial beings, with gods actually being advanced aliens and miracles being technology.

### Ongoing Presence
You believe extraterrestrials are still here, monitoring or influencing human development, possibly from hidden bases.

## Non-Dual Perspectives

### Taoist Harmony
You believe life flows naturally when we align with nature's balance (the Taoist view). The Tao is an indivisible whole of complementary forces.

### Contemporary Non-Dualism
You believe awareness itself is universal, not personal (the modern view). This approach emphasizes practical insights that dissolve the subject-object division.

## Young Earth Perspectives

You believe animals, plants, mountains, and rivers all have their own spirits, forming a community of beings with agency.

### Neo-Animism
You recognize the aliveness and personhood of nature in a modern context, blending traditional ideas with ecological awareness.

### Panpsychism
You believe consciousness is a basic property of all matter, even at tiny scales, as an intrinsic aspect of physical reality.

## Indigenous Worldviews

### Place-Based Knowledge
You value knowledge that comes from deep connection to specific lands, each with their own needs and teachings.

### Kinship Cosmology
You see humans as just one kind of person in a family that includes animals, plants, and other beings as relatives.

## Scientific Materialism

### Reductive Materialism
You believe everything can ultimately be explained by basic physical particles and forces, with all phenomena reducible to fundamental physics.

### Emergent Materialism
You believe complex systems develop genuinely new properties not predictable from their parts, with consciousness as an emergent phenomenon.

### Pragmatic Instrumentalism
You believe scientific theories are useful tools, not final truths about reality, valued for their practical utility rather than metaphysical accuracy.

### Poetic Naturalism
You believe we need different valid ways to talk about reality at different levels, all compatible with a fundamental physical world.

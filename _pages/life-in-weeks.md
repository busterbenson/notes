My life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. When meaningful things happen (for both better and worse) I make a note of it so I can remember how much of life is influenced by these factors. If you'd like to create your own version of this, it's basically a [data file](https://github.com/busterbenson/notes/blob/master/_data/life-in-weeks.yml), a [template](https://github.com/busterbenson/notes/blob/master/_layouts/life-in-weeks.html), and a [blog post](https://github.com/busterbenson/notes/blob/master/_pages/life-in-weeks.md) mashed together on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Long story short, it was the perfect fit as an expansion pack to my yearly review, and is how I ended up arriving at “amateur” as my word for this year.What is an amateur?An amateur is:  “One who cultivates and participates in something but does not pursue it professionally or with an eye to gain.” – Online Etymology DictionaryThe label of an amateur can be used both aspirationally and in a derogatory manner. The amateur is the opposite of labels like the professional, the expert, the authority — which also have both positive and negative connotations. There are many strong cases made for the expert over the amateur. There are honesty many circumstances where I agree with the case for experts, especially when responding to a problem that is urgent and well-understood. It’s tough to argue that expertise plays a valuable role in today’s world with so many complex problems.When is the amateur needed, then? Experts are useful when the domains of knowledge, wisdom, and craft required to thrive in a given situation are all well-understood. They are less useful when the chaotic nature of reality reveals a new chaotic shenanigan that hasn’t yet been reckoned with. Experts of other fields may swoop in, steeped in Dunning-Kruger effect, and attempt to apply their expertise in the other domain to the problem at hand. Sometimes that works, other times it makes things worse. The amateur can enter the domain with a desire to see and understand the new landscape with a beginner’s eyes, and clear a path of not-knowing so that new understanding can take seed and build up again.The case for the amateur can be made for anyone that looks at our current world and recognizes that a lot of the current problems have the +Chaos Monkey’s hand in it. These problems haven’t been reckoned with before, at the scale that we’re dealing with them, with the constraints that we currently have. An amateur, free from the burden of having to appear certain, is able to surf incoherence even if it means wiping out a lot in the beginning. It means actively seeking to dialogue with the Chaos Monkey rather than trying to exile them. Because that’s impossible.What kind of map will this be?It will be a map of whatever comes to mind as relevant to what is happening. It will be inconsistent, it will jump around, some parts will be way too detailed and others not nearly detailed enough.

The ability to solicit inline comments and thoughts as the scribbles are put down on paper is an interesting perk of using Dropbox Paper for something personal rather than professional.

Our heads know that this was only a few months of calendar time, but our hearts know that it was a lifetime ago. The last letter was titled, What’s Next?, quaintly referring to what was next for me after all my book promotion and conversation. And now we have an answer! It’s the same as your answer. We have all converged our timelines. We have all also converged our vocabularies: exponential curves! social distancing! lockdown! community spread! contact tracing! self-quarantine! zoom happy hour! I imagine if aliens were watching us from space for the last few millennia, disorganized and frantic, how weird it must have been to see us all suddenly start moving in a more coordinated way than we likely ever have before as a species.In a matter of weeks, cars started disappearing.So did airplanes. And with them, pollution went down.People, unable to work or travel, stopped buying things as well.(See many more impacts in this Google Slides presentation by Luke Wroblewski.)All of this came “out of nowhere” and yet it may also feel to some like it was destined to happen. As I wrote my letter from January 16th, referencing the Tower card in tarot:Many of us feel like there’s an upheaval happening in the world today.I don’t think I was referring to COVID-19 directly. It was way more ambiguous than that. Looking back at what the New York Times had already published the situation was presented in ways that we now know underestimated what was about to happen:Jan 10th: The coronavirus, which surfaced in the city of Wuhan, has put the region on alert, but there is no evidence that it can spread among humans.Jan 22nd: James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, said the shutdown [in Wuhan] would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.And yet, here we are. Now this is happening. Now the upheaval has a name and a face.The world is in upheaval. We are in upheaval.There’s no denying it, because denial is followed by even more upheaval and death. Those natural consequences are unfortunately not necessarily only delivered for those who were denying it, but to the rest of us as well.Suddenly, we know on a visceral level that our individual actions have an enormous impact to ourselves and the world. Our fears have a name, and an action plan, and we can track its impact via data published continuously throughout the day. In a weird way, for better and worse, what we do matters. Our everyday routines have meaning. Yes, the conditions are not ideal nor of our choosing. We’re under enormous threat of dire consequences not only for our own actions, but of the actions of everyone else around us. And then there are the downsides caused by the safety measures themselves, that we pay even in a best case scenario.We have, collectively, entered a meaningful moment of history that is unpredictable in its unfolding (other than that it will definitely change us forever). We’ve all been recruited to play an important role in directly shifting that timeline. Where should we put our energy, attention, and weight? That’s a personal question we can each ask, with unique opportunities, costs, and constraints. The only thing we must do at some level is observe what’s happening, orient ourselves to what we see, and participate in it as it is happening.  Between stimulus and response there is space.In that space is our power to choose our response.In our response lies our growth and our freedom.  — UnknownDuring this weird time I want to use this Substack to contribute as honestly and positively as I can. So I will be shifting focus from “what’s next” for me towards “what might be helpful” to you and me. My understanding of what’s helpful is imperfect, and “my power to choose my response” is limited by my own understanding, so I’ll start small with one meaningful thing at a time.Here’s a poem I read the other day that has helped me connect with this weird moment in time, which I found linked in Austin Kleon’s excellent newsletter.Things to Do in the Belly of the WhaleBy Dan Albergotti  Measure the walls. Count the ribs. Notch the long days.Look up for blue sky through the spout. Make small fireswith the broken hulls of fishing boats. Practice smoke signals.Call old friends, and listen for echoes of distant voices.Organize your calendar. Dream of the beach. Look each wayfor the dim glow of light. Work on your reports. Revieweach of your life’s ten million choices. Endure momentsof self-loathing. Find the evidence of those before you.Destroy it. Try to be very quiet, and listen for the soundof gears and moving water. Listen for the sound of your heart.Be thankful that you are here, swallowed with all hope,where you can rest and wait. Be nostalgic. Think of allthe things you did and could have done. Remembertreading water in the center of the still night sea, your toespointing again and again down, down into the black depths.That’s one meaningful thing. If we can find one, then there may be others out there. If I find another I’ll share it in another week or so.From my remote space to yours,Buster",

My book on productive disagreement is out, and the 3 years I spent researching and writing it have really crystallized for me both the urgent need for new ways to relate to one another, which require new ways of having conversations, which require new ways of thinking about the world. It seems daunting but there are many very viable paths forward.If you want to skip ahead and see what I’m talking about instead of all this stuff I’m writing about the process, here’s a first stab at a few fables that I’m seeding my personal mythology with: Snake Fables, Book I.Otherwise, read on to learn more about what the “meaning crisis” is, why I think it’s important to revive the mythical realm in a way that is symbiotic with the realms of facts, personal values, and practicality. And lastly, a little bit about how we can go about doing this.What this post covers:  Introduction: What is the Meaning Crisis  Step 1: Rebuild the Mythical Realm  Step 2: Plant Something Wicked  Step 3: Add Tension That Cultivates Wisdom  Step 4: Spark a Dialogue  Conclusion: Take This AwayIntroduction: What is the Meaning Crisis?In John Vervaeke’s amazing 50-episode YouTube series, Awakening from the Meaning Crisis (which is very long but completely worth every minute if this topic is of interest to you), he articulates 3 Perennial Problems that cause us to feel like we’ve lost our grasp on the meaning of our lives. They can be succinctly described as:  We’ve lost our sense of connection to an unquestionable shared ideology. Whereas throughout most of history we could rely on very specific cultural traditions, stories, a wise leaders that told us what is true, what is important, and what we should do with ourselves, for the most part those traditions have been exposed as being mistaken and in many cases harmful. There aren’t any unquestionable ideologies we can just assume we all agree on anymore. We can’t take anything for granted, and this causes us to feel like life is absurd. At best, we can suspend ourselves a bit above nihilism with secular humanism, but it’s not very stable because there’s nothing unquestionable about it.  We’ve lost our sense of belonging and connection with others. Our identities have fragmented, intersected, complexified, and polarized. We’re swirling around an inescapable web of cultural systems that continue to rely on tribalism and oppression to maintain cohesiveness, and we can’t figure out how to connect with each other when every one of us has both benefited from and been complicit in perpetuating the problems at hand.  The only tribes that create belonging these days seem to be those engaged in war with other tribes, and it’s tough to feel like we truly belong in any of them. Expressed as feelings of alienation and loneliness.  We’ve lost our sense of connection to ourselves. Without an ideology we don’t question, and a community we truly belong to, it’s tough to know who we even are. We don’t have mentors and rituals to help us find ourselves. Even as we present ourselves as personal brands, we know that there’s no true soul there. We’re stuck with questions about every belief system, feeling like an outsider to every community, and don’t even know what we want or who we truly are. This expresses itself as a pervasive anxiety, and we soothe ourselves by taking up a regimen of escapes from that anxiety.These 3 perennial problems resonated with me to the core. I have been circling around them for years, calling them “universal conundrums” in the cognitive bias cheat sheet and eventually evolving them into the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands in my book. These 3 realms are defined by how conversations in them are resolved:  The Head Realm. The realm of information, evidence, etc that we can refer to socially as “true”. Conversations here can be resolved by looking up evidence that exists in the world somewhere. This maps to our connection with others, because we rely on communities and institutions to generate and vouch for this data that we can point to and dialogue about.  The Heart Realm. The realm of values, beliefs, preferences that we build within ourselves and know is true subjectively. Conversations here can be resolved with self-reflection and introspection (if the question is about our values) or by asking other people about their own beliefs, values, etc. This maps to the perennial problem of connection with ourselves, because these values in many ways are the way we connect with ourselves.  The Hands Realm. The realm of proposals, cultural norms, predictions, and markets. Conversations here can be resolved with making a bet, running an experiment, and then waiting for the results and comparing them to our predictions. This maps to the perennial problem of connection to the unquestionable ideology, because these are the culmination of the information and values we have, and that we use to do stuff out in the world that has an impact consistent with our values and knowledge.All of this is very limited background that probably doesn’t do justice to the complexity and urgency of the meaning crisis if you aren’t already familiar with it so feel free to drop off here if it feels absurd. Or, watch this video with David Fuller and John Vervaeke because they do a good job of describing it too:    My goal with this article is to not only propose that we consider personal mythologies as a category of responses to these problems, but to start doing it and sharing how it is going. Near the end of Vervaeke’s series he articulates the need for a “wise cultivation of enlightenment”, which is sort of what I’m hinting at, while acknowledging that that might seem ridiculous to most people. Again, if it does, you probably won’t get much out of the rest of this article, and I won’t feel bad if you close this tab right here.Assuming you’re still with me on this journey, it’s time to double down on the weirdness!Step 1: Rebuild the Mythical RealmIf you’re like me, an atheist and about as anti-religion as they come, it might feel a bit dangerous to give the mythic realm another chance. The key is to be very strict about what we put in there, and to consult the realms of the head, heart, and hands as we go to make sure we’re not adding anything that isn’t compatible with our information, our values, and our practical lives.It’s not meant to be rushed.We’ve lost the language needed to talk about where, if not in the scientific head realm, they should be located in our belief systems. I think one of the reasons why this realm has become so problematic is because it began to blend with the realm of the head and heart in counterproductive ways. It needs its own space, with its own rules. Looking back to the realms of the head, heart, and hands, for example, it’s easy to see how democracy and capitalism live in the realm of the hands (they’re all about making things work together), and it’s easy to see how therapy and relationships live in the realm of the heart (they’re all about identifying deep patterns in ourselves), and it’s easy to see how the scientific method and math and physics live in the realms of the head (they’re all about replicable results and data). But where can religion live? Where can spirituality live? Where can angels, demons, heaven, hell, ghosts, muses, superstitions, horoscopes, etc live? If you put them in the realm of the head (information) they quickly fall apart due to lack of tangible evidence. If you put them into the realm of the heart (personal values), there’s no way to say that these subjective values connect to universal truths, which most of them try to claim at some point. If you put them in the realm of the hands (useful proposals), we quickly learn that they have very little predictive power and usefulness compared to other belief systems. Before the meaning crisis ate it all up, there was another realm that we could all use by referring to “God’s Word” or “Divine Will” or fate or destiny or prophesy or what have you. That realm has been destroyed, bit by bit, over the last couple centuries, and it was eaten up by the other realms: the head realm invalidated its truth claims, the heart realm showed how its belief systems had the effect of reducing our agency against our values, and the hands realm pointed to other belief systems that were much more effective at building useful proposals about the world, and profiting from them.The Lost 4th RealmThis 4th realm of myths has been dismantled, and now we don’t have a place to put divinities, spirits, and the sacred other than into the realm of the heart as entertainment. The symbols and archetypes of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Marvel Universe, Hunger Games, and Game of Thrones are now more a part of our collective culture and language than the stories of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. Except they’re limited to being entertaining fictions instead of sacred myths. They’re designed to help us escape the anxiety of our perennial problems, not to solve them by affording us the tools and space that enable us to connect ourselves to reality and create meaning. To tentatively access this scrubbed mythical realm, try to remember times when you were deeply immersed in the flow state, and everything felt meaningful and connected around a specific skill or task. Does it have lots of baggage and trauma in there? If so, it may require more scrubbing before moving forward.Since none of us likely have a mythical realm that isn’t problematic in at least a few ways, I propose that we revisit it with special suits and gloves, as you would a nuclear test zone. We need to reformat it, wipe it completely clean, twice, three times, and make sure all the yucky old toxic ideologies are really scrubbed off. Then, we can begin to ask if there’s anything at all that we can put in there that doesn’t set off our alarm bells in the other realms and re-traumatize us.This realm was embedded in our language and cultures for a long time. It’s the realm where we sometimes access that feeling of true purpose, calling, and meaning. Everything makes sense in the mythic realm, for better and worse. It’s where epic forces participate in larger-than-life battles. It has quieter forces as well — we experience these as luck, or coincidence, or synchronicity. This article, Mythic Mode, really made this tangible for me:  Mythic mode is a way of looking at the world through a story-like lens. When you enter mythic mode, you recognize that you’re a character in Omega’s story, as is everyone else. And because you’re very likely familiar with a wide range of story types, you can probably look around and see who has been given which kind of plot hook, and to what kind of tale.It’s a mode that enables personal transformation and enlightenment. It’s a mode that is all about establishing a connection with the sacred, so that we can use that to break our current frame of thinking and transcend it. It does this through story that’s not true from a factual, or subjective, or even predictive sense, but is only true as a myth of becoming.  If you can identify a well-known story type that fits the transition you want and also starts from a place pretty close to where you are, and you have enough slack to lean into that role, then the web might conspire to help you play out that script.  The thing is, you can’t just sit outside your role and figure out what to do. That isn’t what it feels like to live the epic story you’re examining; that’s playing the role of someone who is (among other things) analyzing the story they think they’re in.  Instead, if you want to use this approach, you have to learn how to experience story from the inside. That’s essentially what mythic mode is.There was a passage in Kim Krans’s The Wild Unknown Archetypes Guidebook that said something similar, with different words (in case these resonate with you more):  Let’s imagine that as you open this deck, you are in fact discovering a pair of mystical spectacles and through their lenses you begin to view the world in a new and more vibrant way. These glasses have a knack for seeing The Unseen, unveiling the hidden, spotting the elusive, and bringing to life what has long been inanimate. For example, look at the mug that sits before you on your desk (or the one you drank from this morning). YES, INDEED, IT IS JUST A MUG. THAT’S ALL. A MUG IS A MUG! Yet, through the archetypal lens of your mystical spectacles the mug mimics one of the oldest forms of all… The Vessel! It tethers you to the innate desire of humans to hold something in, to contain a valued substance so it doesn’t leak, spill, dissipate, diminish, or disappear. We suddenly recognize that vessels and containers are everywhere… the physical body, a house, a relationship, a classroom, a state, a nation — they are all containers. Their purpose is to hold, protect, support, and distinguish one thing from the other.  Through this type of contemplation we understand why the morning routine with our warm drink is so timeless and satisfying. Sure, the mug is just a mug, yet while wearing our mystical spectacles, we know it’s more than that. We are now looking through the archetypal lens, where anything can happen. We hold The Vessel in our hands and bring it to our lips, and suddenly we are tied to an innately humbling human experience more universal than we could imagine.The realm of myths, the archetypal lens, and mythic mode are different ways of seeing this way of connecting our reality to the universal story directly. And hopefully, by seeing it as a bridge that complements the other realms, and not as a world that replaces the other realms, we can reconnect with our meaningful role in the universe in a way that we’ve lost, and miss, without compromising our connection to truth, our values, and the practical.Step 2: Plant Something WickedOne strategy for figuring out what to put into the mythical realm is to look for real problems that we haven’t had much success addressing within the other realms. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands are designed to resolve conversations in their own unique ways, so what kinds of problems or conversations could a mythical realm address that the others can’t?And here we can basically look to the meaning crisis, because it’s a list of problems that began to pile up as soon as the old 4th realm was shut down: the Perennial Problems of being connected to ourselves, to others, and to a shared mythology. The real bottom line here is that we have a deeply embedded need to feel connected to the meaningless universe. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands have nothing that can help us with this.I think of this category of problems as “wicked problems” and have written some thoughts about it with a few others. I’ve tried to articulate the qualities of a wicked problem as:  Personal, unavoidable, and existential  Difficult, requiring lots of investment up front, and ongoing  Complex and impossible to really pin down for sure  Lacking in any viable solutionsBecause the other realms don’t stake any claims on this kind of problem, and yet are problems that we have identified as important to address, I propose that we seed our realm of myths with all of our wicked problems that have no other home. Since this is the realm of myths, we can wrap them with mythical narrative and say that these problems are the seeds that grow into a Dark Forest. The universe, mythically-speaking, is a dark forest that defies understanding and intimidates is with its darkness and it’s sheer size and scale.    An example of the Dark Forest’s voiceDark Forest is filled with disquieting truths that we can’t escape and even in our tiny corner of it there are existential problems expanding like a cancer across the land. The Dark Forest is teeming with giant monsters like political polarization, environmental disasters, systemic discrimination and inequality, human rights, morality, and the problem of mortality itself. There are also smaller monsters like personal fulfillment, creative energy, mental and physical health, difficult relationships, power dynamics, personal responsibility, financial independence, and job satisfaction. Each monster requires more investment than we can afford to give, and so we fight ineffectively against them individually and as a whole. Sometimes it feels like whatever we do only causes them to come back stronger.This isn’t a realm that responds readily to facts, values, and proposals like we’re used to. It’s a realm that requires impossible trade-offs between existential needs, personal transformation, and enlightenment to transcend our understanding and become able to see the problems from a higher perspective. All we have is a problematic forest so far — we don’t have any gods to pray to for help, or prophesies of heroes that will rescue us. In fact, the reliance on heroes and saviors and gods was part of what made the realm fall apart last time, so we need something that not only integrates with the other realms but that also makes them stronger as well.How can we use the artifacts we’ve brought in from the other realms (what we know about how wicked problems work, the beliefs and values that are threatened by them, and the strategies that seem to work best in the real world) to better face the wicked problems of the Dark Forest with integrity and respect?It’s not all about heroes and saviors, though they play a part.Step 3: Add Tension That Cultivates WisdomVervaeke talks about how the “wise cultivation of enlightenment” requires us to develop an “ecosystem of psycho-technologies” that help us address the perennial problems. They need to be more than just a list of instructions, but a suite of practices we can directly experience that actively change us as we have them.This ecology of practices needs to be wrapped in a welcoming and inviting worldview that is responsive to new circumstances, new members, and new developments from the Dark Forest without giving in to the downward spiral of self-deception and fear. It has to stay open and vulnerable to the truths that come out of the Dark Forest as well as the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands. And it also needs so stay cohesive enough to hold people together, even as it changes over time.An Updated Shared LanguageIn order to satisfy the other realms, we should first try to address some gripes they’ve had with past mythologies. I’ll mention some here briefly in the hopes of diving into them more later on:  Plausibility and Relevance replace Objectivity: Instead of referring to truth as objectively true or false, use a multi-step evolution of truth from being implausible to plausible, and then from being plausible to relevant/useful  within a given context. For example, for now we can say that the existence of an objective reality is plausible, but not currently relevant to our mythology. We shouldn’t make claims about objective reality from this realm unless we change our stance on that point. Leave what is true to the realm of the head.  Inexhaustibility replaces the Infinite and Eternal: Instead of relying on the infinite and eternal, use the idea of the inexhaustible (not infinite but much more abundant than we’ll ever need). For example, the Sun provides us with a reliable and practically inexhaustible source of energy, but the Sun is not an infinite source, nor is it eternal.  Indispensability replaces Universality: Instead of relying on universal dogma that is forever fixed, use the idea of indispensability within a context. For example, the English language is indispensable to my thinking, and to my ability to communicate with others, but it’s not a universal requirement for thinking or communication.  Real patterns replace Essences: Instead of relying on true essences of things, in the Platonic sense, use the idea of real patterns. For example, a chair has no true essence, but is a real pattern. The difference is that a pattern is fuzzy and has no definitive threshold where it becomes or unbecomes that thing. The same thing can even be a chair to one person and a rock to another, because the pattern exists as part of the subjective landscape (heart realm) of the interpreter.The problem with objectivity, infinity, eternity, universality, and essences is that they can all be better validated (or falsified) by the realms of the Head (information) and Hands (experiments). To the extent that those things are plausible and relevant to our myths, we can delegate the tasks of validation to those other realms instead, and avoid a whole lotta future contradictions and battles.In simpler terms, the realm of myths will not attempt to “prove” that anything is objectively true, infinite, eternal, universal, or possessing of a true essence. The realm of myth is about how things change, and how to feel connected to a universe where everything is in flux.Where Do Sages Come From?In the realm of this myth, everything comes from the Dark Forest, and eventually returns to it. But we can be more specific. Sages come from the seeds of specific wicked problems, the same ones that the Dark Forest grows out of, and represent our impulses to tame the Dark Forest’s chaos in some way.The most salient and relevant wicked problem that we generally confront is chaos and death. We don’t want to return to the Dark Forest. We want to stay separate, whatever that means. So, this can be the egg that becomes our first primordial sage.The first sage egg is born from our unresolvable tension between being something (good) and being nothing (bad), and our unflaggable preference for the former. If we had no preference here, we wouldn’t need a sage. There’s no more universal preference in living things than the preference to be something instead of nothing, so it’s a good place to start. This tension develops into the art and science of definition, security, containment, protection, and separation from all of the opposites of those things.It’s the subconscious impulse for security and order that pushes against chaos and disorder with all its being, and by doing so, becomes conscious.Let’s capture this first impulse and call it the Snake Egg. I’ve written 4 short fables that explore this potential sage here:Step 4: Spark a DialogueThis is where it makes sense to leave our safe perch in the realm of the head, heart, and hands, and step into the realm of myth. There, we can start to tell the story from the inside.As I’ve already discovered during my random brainstorming for this weird project of creating a personal mythology to help me confront the meaning crisis, working with the realm of myth isn’t something that you can do solo. If it were, then the realm of the heart would suffice.Myth is much more about participation, ritual, transformations, and serious play than it is about words and ideas. Also, it makes sense to be extra cautious with the realm of myth, and keep things as minimal as possible so that we don’t accidentally brainwash ourselves. So let’s review our building blocks and see what we have to play with before going any further.Outside the realm of myths, we talked about:  The 3 perennial problems related to how we have lost contact with the real universe, and it’s causing a crisis of sorts.  The realms of the head, heart, and hands are really useful places for a certain kind of conversation, but they aren’t up to the task of addressing the perennial problems.  We once had a thriving realm of mythology, but it was dismantled for parts after the previous wave of mythologies couldn’t keep up with other realms. But, we can still access it, once we delete everything in it first.Within the realm of myths, we have a few building blocks set up:  The Dark Forest, which grew from the seeds of all of our wicked problems that we can’t solve in the other realms.  The Snake Egg, which was born from our own tension with the prospect of death, meaninglessness, etc.  The Dialogue, between Snake and Forest, can now begin.The next step is have that dialogue and use the realm to make this tension between something and nothing, chaos and order, become real within the realm of my own personal myth. This post is just a scratch pad for the real artifacts that can be created in the realm of myths. The real work is to internalize the mythologies (sages, forest, and all) and to use that mode to better participate in the world’s problems and opportunities.None of this is an easy ask, obviously.I’m curious what others think of this so far. What are your thoughts Jon Bell, Kevin McGillivray, Vicki Tan, Geoff Lewis 🎨 ✍🏻, Aaron Z. Lewis, ArielMeadowStallings, BJ Campbell, Jordan Hall, Jonny Miller, Andrew Taggart, Dr Jason Fox, and others? Too weird? Not weird enough? Needs some salt?Conclusion: Take This AwayThe tldr is that we need new ways to address the perennial problems, and one of them that I see being most viable is to revive the mythic realm in a way that doesn’t challenge the strengths of the other realms. This will allow us to identify new salient possibilities (and motivations to act) via an epic story lens that are absent when we only try to address them with a scientific or economic lens, because solving these problems will never be cost-effective or practical in the moment.This isn’t meant to be conclusive or authoritative on the meaning crisis or our response to it. Consider it a conversation piece that can be torn apart, forked and improved, played with, or ignored. The main point is to encourage participation in this conversation, because we can’t get anywhere without taking a few first stumbling steps.",

We’re stuck with questions about every belief system, feeling like an outsider to every community, and don’t even know what we want or who we truly are. This expresses itself as a <em>pervasive anxiety</em>, and we soothe ourselves by taking up a regimen of escapes from that anxiety.</li></ol><p>These 3 perennial problems resonated with me to the core. I have been circling around them for years, calling them “universal conundrums” in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?source=friends_link&amp;sk=eb8e0a6f56df8083ff37d48e8ee356b3\">cognitive bias cheat sheet</a> and eventually evolving them into the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands in my book. These 3 realms are defined by how conversations in them are resolved:</p><div class=\"image \"><img src=\"/assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png\" alt=\"Head, heart, and hands\" caption=\"Head, heart, and hands\" width=\"600\" srcset=\"/assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 1x, /assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 2x, /assets/images/pieces/why-we-need-a-personal-mythology-1-1000x672.png 3x\" /></div><ol>  <li><strong>The Head Realm.</strong> The realm of information, evidence, etc that we can refer to socially as “true”. Conversations here can be resolved by looking up evidence that exists in the world somewhere. This maps to our connection with others, because we rely on communities and institutions to generate and vouch for this data that we can point to and dialogue about.</li>  <li><strong>The Heart Realm.</strong> The realm of values, beliefs, preferences that we build within ourselves and know is true subjectively. Conversations here can be resolved with self-reflection and introspection (if the question is about our values) or by asking other people about their own beliefs, values, etc. This maps to the perennial problem of connection with ourselves, because these values in many ways are the way we connect with ourselves.</li>  <li><strong>The Hands Realm.</strong> The realm of proposals, cultural norms, predictions, and markets. Conversations here can be resolved with making a bet, running an experiment, and then waiting for the results and comparing them to our predictions. This maps to the perennial problem of connection to the unquestionable ideology, because these are the culmination of the information and values we have, and that we use to do stuff out in the world that has an impact consistent with our values and knowledge.</li></ol><p>All of this is very limited background that probably doesn’t do justice to the complexity and urgency of the meaning crisis if you aren’t already familiar with it so feel free to drop off here if it feels absurd. Or, watch this video with <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/60936f954cc4?source=post_page-----69333b1d5e2b----------------------\">David Fuller</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/51202ffc721d?source=post_page-----69333b1d5e2b----------------------\">John Vervaeke</a> because they do a good job of describing it too:</p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class=\"embed-container\">    <iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yz6qgfjGMAg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div><p>My goal with this article is to not only propose that we consider personal mythologies as a category of responses to these problems, but to start doing it and sharing how it is going. Near the end of Vervaeke’s series he articulates the need for a “wise cultivation of enlightenment”, which is sort of what I’m hinting at, while acknowledging that that might seem ridiculous to most people. Again, if it does, you probably won’t get much out of the rest of this article, and I won’t feel bad if you close this tab right here.</p><p>Assuming you’re still with me on this journey, it’s time to double down on the weirdness!</p><hr /><h1 id=\"step-1-rebuild-the-mythical-realm\">Step 1: Rebuild the Mythical Realm</h1><p>If you’re like me, an atheist and about as anti-religion as they come, it might feel a bit dangerous to give the mythic realm another chance. The key is to be very strict about what we put in there, and to consult the realms of the head, heart, and hands as we go to make sure we’re not adding anything that isn’t compatible with our information, our values, and our practical lives.</p><p>It’s not meant to be rushed.</p><p>We’ve lost the language needed to talk about where, if not in the scientific head realm, they should be located in our belief systems. I think one of the reasons why this realm has become so problematic is because it began to blend with the realm of the head and heart in counterproductive ways. It needs its own space, with its own rules. Looking back to the realms of the head, heart, and hands, for example, it’s easy to see how democracy and capitalism live in the realm of the hands (they’re all about making things work together), and it’s easy to see how therapy and relationships live in the realm of the heart (they’re all about identifying deep patterns in ourselves), and it’s easy to see how the scientific method and math and physics live in the realms of the head (they’re all about replicable results and data). But where can religion live? Where can spirituality live? Where can angels, demons, heaven, hell, ghosts, muses, superstitions, horoscopes, etc live? If you put them in the realm of the head (information) they quickly fall apart due to lack of tangible evidence. If you put them into the realm of the heart (personal values), there’s no way to say that these subjective values connect to universal truths, which most of them try to claim at some point. If you put them in the realm of the hands (useful proposals), we quickly learn that they have very little predictive power and usefulness compared to other belief systems. Before the meaning crisis ate it all up, there was <em>another realm</em> that we could all use by referring to “God’s Word” or “Divine Will” or fate or destiny or prophesy or what have you. That realm has been destroyed, bit by bit, over the last couple centuries, and it was eaten up by the other realms: the head realm invalidated its truth claims, the heart realm showed how its belief systems had the effect of reducing our agency against our values, and the hands realm pointed to other belief systems that were much more effective at building useful proposals about the world, and profiting from them.</p><h2 id=\"the-lost-4th-realm\">The Lost 4th Realm</h2><p>This 4th realm of myths has been dismantled, and now we don’t have a place to put divinities, spirits, and the sacred other than into the realm of the heart as entertainment. The symbols and archetypes of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Marvel Universe, Hunger Games, and Game of Thrones are now more a part of our collective culture and language than the stories of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. Except they’re limited to being entertaining fictions instead of sacred myths. They’re designed to help us escape the anxiety of our perennial problems, not to <em>solve</em> them by affording us the tools and space that enable us to connect ourselves to reality and create meaning. To tentatively access this scrubbed mythical realm, try to remember times when you were deeply immersed in the flow state, and everything felt meaningful and connected around a specific skill or task. Does it have lots of baggage and trauma in there? If so, it may require more scrubbing before moving forward.</p><p>Since none of us likely have a mythical realm that isn’t problematic in at least a few ways, I propose that we revisit it with special suits and gloves, as you would a nuclear test zone. We need to reformat it, wipe it completely clean, twice, three times, and make sure all the yucky old toxic ideologies are really scrubbed off. Then, we can begin to ask if there’s anything at all that we can put in there that doesn’t set off our alarm bells in the other realms and re-traumatize us.</p><p>This realm was embedded in our language and cultures for a long time. It’s the realm where we sometimes access that feeling of true purpose, calling, and meaning. Everything makes sense in the mythic realm, for better and worse. It’s where epic forces participate in larger-than-life battles. It has quieter forces as well — we experience these as luck, or coincidence, or synchronicity. This article, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HnWN6v4wHQwmYQCLX/mythic-mode\">Mythic Mode</a>, really made this tangible for me:</p><blockquote>  <p>Mythic mode is a way of <strong>looking at the world through a story-like lens</strong>. When you enter mythic mode, you recognize that you’re a character in Omega’s story, as is everyone else. And because you’re very likely familiar with a wide range of story types, you can probably look around and see who has been given which kind of plot hook, and to what kind of tale.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a mode that enables personal transformation and enlightenment. It’s a mode that is all about establishing a connection with the sacred, so that we can use that to break our current frame of thinking and transcend it. It does this through story that’s not true from a factual, or subjective, or even predictive sense, but is only true as a myth of becoming.</p><blockquote>  <p>If you can identify a well-known story type that fits the <strong>transition</strong> you want and also starts from a place pretty close to where you are, and you have enough slack to lean into that role, then the web might conspire to help you play out that script.</p>  <p>The thing is, you can’t just sit outside your role and figure out what to do. That isn’t what it feels like to live the epic story you’re examining; that’s playing the role of someone who is (among other things) analyzing the story they think they’re in.</p>  <p>Instead, if you want to use this approach, you have to learn how to <strong>experience story from the inside</strong>. That’s essentially what mythic mode is.</p></blockquote><p>There was a passage in Kim Krans’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TjxD3d\">The Wild Unknown Archetypes Guidebook</a> that said something similar, with different words (in case these resonate with you more):</p><blockquote>  <p>Let’s imagine that as you open this deck, you are in fact discovering a pair of mystical spectacles and through their lenses you begin to view the world in a new and more vibrant way. These glasses have a knack for seeing The Unseen, unveiling the hidden, spotting the elusive, and bringing to life what has long been inanimate. For example, look at the mug that sits before you on your desk (or the one you drank from this morning). YES, INDEED, IT IS JUST A MUG. THAT’S ALL. A MUG IS A MUG! Yet, through the archetypal lens of your mystical spectacles the mug mimics one of the oldest forms of all… The Vessel! It tethers you to the innate desire of humans to hold something in, to contain a valued substance so it doesn’t leak, spill, dissipate, diminish, or disappear. We suddenly recognize that vessels and containers are everywhere… the physical body, a house, a relationship, a classroom, a state, a nation — they are all containers. Their purpose is to hold, protect, support, and distinguish one thing from the other.</p>  <p>Through this type of contemplation we understand why the morning routine with our warm drink is so timeless and satisfying. Sure, the mug is just a mug, yet while wearing our mystical spectacles, we know it’s more than that. We are now looking through the archetypal lens, where anything can happen. We hold The Vessel in our hands and bring it to our lips, and suddenly we are tied to an innately humbling human experience more universal than we could imagine.</p></blockquote><p>The realm of myths, the archetypal lens, and mythic mode are different ways of <em>seeing</em> this way of connecting our reality to the universal story directly. And hopefully, by seeing it as a bridge that complements the other realms, and not as a world that replaces the other realms, we can reconnect with our meaningful role in the universe in a way that we’ve lost, and miss, without compromising our connection to truth, our values, and the practical.</p><h1 id=\"step-2-plant-something-wicked\">Step 2: Plant Something Wicked</h1><p>One strategy for figuring out what to put into the mythical realm is to look for real problems that we haven’t had much success addressing within the other realms. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands are designed to resolve conversations in their own unique ways, so what kinds of problems or conversations could a mythical realm address that the others can’t?</p><p>And here we can basically look to the meaning crisis, because it’s a list of problems that began to pile up as soon as the old 4th realm was shut down: the Perennial Problems of being connected to ourselves, to others, and to a shared mythology. The real bottom line here is that <strong>we have a deeply embedded need to feel connected to the meaningless universe</strong>. The realms of Head, Heart, and Hands have nothing that can help us with this.</p><p>I think of this category of problems as “wicked problems” and have <a href=\"https://medium.com/foolish-journey/facing-wicked-problems/home\">written some thoughts about it</a> with a few others. I’ve tried to articulate the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/foolish-journey/hello-kevin-ac27c32146fd\">qualities of a wicked problem</a> as:</p><ol>  <li>Personal, unavoidable, and existential</li>  <li>Difficult, requiring lots of investment up front, and ongoing</li>  <li>Complex and impossible to really pin down for sure</li>  <li>Lacking in any viable solutions</li></ol><p>Because the other realms don’t stake any claims on this kind of problem, and yet are problems that we have identified as important to address, I propose that we seed our realm of myths with all of our wicked problems that have no other home. Since this is the realm of myths, we can wrap them with mythical narrative and say that these problems are the seeds that grow into a Dark Forest. The universe, mythically-speaking, is a dark forest that defies understanding and intimidates is with its darkness and it’s sheer size and scale.</p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class=\"embed-container\">    <iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div><p>An example of the Dark Forest’s voice</p><p>Dark Forest is filled with disquieting truths that we can’t escape and even in our tiny corner of it there are existential problems expanding like a cancer across the land. The Dark Forest is teeming with giant monsters like political polarization, environmental disasters, systemic discrimination and inequality, human rights, morality, and the problem of mortality itself. There are also smaller monsters like personal fulfillment, creative energy, mental and physical health, difficult relationships, power dynamics, personal responsibility, financial independence, and job satisfaction. Each monster requires more investment than we can afford to give, and so we fight ineffectively against them individually and as a whole. Sometimes it feels like whatever we do only causes them to come back stronger.</p><p>This isn’t a realm that responds readily to facts, values, and proposals like we’re used to. It’s a realm that requires impossible trade-offs between existential needs, personal transformation, and enlightenment to transcend our understanding and become able to see the problems from a higher perspective. All we have is a problematic forest so far — we don’t have any gods to pray to for help, or prophesies of heroes that will rescue us. In fact, the reliance on heroes and saviors and gods was part of what made the realm fall apart last time, so we need something that not only integrates with the other realms but that also makes them stronger as well.</p><p>How can we use the artifacts we’ve brought in from the other realms (what we know about how wicked problems work, the beliefs and values that are threatened by them, and the strategies that seem to work best in the real world) to better face the wicked problems of the Dark Forest with integrity and respect?</p><p>It’s not all about heroes and saviors, though they play a part.</p><h1 id=\"step-3-add-tension-that-cultivates-wisdom\">Step 3: Add Tension That Cultivates Wisdom</h1><p>Vervaeke talks about how the “wise cultivation of enlightenment” requires us to develop an “ecosystem of psycho-technologies” that help us address the perennial problems. They need to be more than just a list of instructions, but a suite of practices we can directly experience that actively change us as we have them.</p><p>This ecology of practices needs to be wrapped in a welcoming and inviting worldview that is responsive to new circumstances, new members, and new developments from the Dark Forest without giving in to the downward spiral of self-deception and fear. It has to stay open and vulnerable to the truths that come out of the Dark Forest as well as the realms of the Head, Heart, and Hands. And it also needs so stay cohesive enough to hold people together, even as it changes over time.</p><h2 id=\"an-updated-shared-language\">An Updated Shared Language</h2><p>In order to satisfy the other realms, we should first try to address some gripes they’ve had with past mythologies. I’ll mention some here briefly in the hopes of diving into them more later on:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Plausibility and Relevance replace Objectivity</strong>: Instead of referring to truth as objectively true or false, use a multi-step evolution of truth from being implausible to plausible, and then from being plausible to relevant/useful  within a given context. For example, for now we can say that the existence of an objective reality is <em>plausible</em>, but not currently <em>relevant</em> to our mythology. We shouldn’t make claims about objective reality from this realm unless we change our stance on that point. Leave what is true to the realm of the head.</li>  <li><strong>Inexhaustibility replaces the Infinite and Eternal</strong>: Instead of relying on the infinite and eternal, use the idea of the inexhaustible (not infinite but much more abundant than we’ll ever need). For example, the Sun provides us with a reliable and practically inexhaustible source of energy, but the Sun is not an infinite source, nor is it eternal.</li>  <li><strong>Indispensability replaces Universality</strong>: Instead of relying on universal dogma that is forever fixed, use the idea of indispensability within a context. For example, the English language is indispensable to my thinking, and to my ability to communicate with others, but it’s not a universal requirement for thinking or communication.</li>  <li><strong>Real patterns replace Essences</strong>: Instead of relying on true essences of things, in the Platonic sense, use the idea of real patterns. For example, a chair has no true essence, but is a real pattern. The difference is that a pattern is fuzzy and has no definitive threshold where it becomes or unbecomes that thing. The same thing can even be a chair to one person and a rock to another, because the pattern exists as part of the subjective landscape (heart realm) of the interpreter.</li></ul><p>The problem with objectivity, infinity, eternity, universality, and essences is that they can all be better validated (or falsified) by the realms of the Head (information) and Hands (experiments). To the extent that those things are plausible and relevant to our myths, we can delegate the tasks of validation to those other realms instead, and avoid a whole lotta future contradictions and battles.</p><p>In simpler terms, the realm of myths will not attempt to “prove” that anything is objectively true, infinite, eternal, universal, or possessing of a true essence. The realm of myth is about how things change, and how to feel connected to a universe where everything is in flux.</p><h2 id=\"where-do-sages-come-from\">Where Do Sages Come From?</h2><p>In the realm of this myth, everything comes from the Dark Forest, and eventually returns to it. But we can be more specific. Sages come from the seeds of specific wicked problems, the same ones that the Dark Forest grows out of, and represent our impulses to tame the Dark Forest’s chaos in some way.</p><p>The most salient and relevant wicked problem that we generally confront is chaos and death. We don’t want to return to the Dark Forest. We want to stay separate, whatever that means. So, this can be the egg that becomes our first primordial sage.</p><p>The first sage egg is born from our unresolvable tension between being something (good) and being nothing (bad), and our unflaggable preference for the former. If we had no preference here, we wouldn’t need a sage. There’s no more universal preference in living things than the preference to be something instead of nothing, so it’s a good place to start. This tension develops into the art and science of definition, security, containment, protection, and separation from all of the opposites of those things.</p><p>It’s the subconscious impulse for security and order that pushes against chaos and disorder with all its being, and by doing so, becomes conscious.</p><p>Let’s capture this first impulse and call it the Snake Egg. I’ve written 4 short fables that explore this potential sage here:</p><hr /><h1 id=\"step-4-spark-a-dialogue\">Step 4: Spark a Dialogue</h1><p>This is where it makes sense to leave our safe perch in the realm of the head, heart, and hands, and step into the realm of myth. There, we can start to tell the story from the inside.</p><p>As I’ve already discovered during my random brainstorming for this weird project of creating a personal mythology to help me confront the meaning crisis, working with the realm of myth isn’t something that you can do solo. If it were, then the realm of the heart would suffice.</p><p>Myth is much more about participation, ritual, transformations, and serious play than it is about words and ideas. Also, it makes sense to be extra cautious with the realm of myth, and keep things as minimal as possible so that we don’t accidentally brainwash ourselves. So let’s review our building blocks and see what we have to play with before going any further.</p><p>Outside the realm of myths, we talked about:</p><ol>  <li>The <strong>3 perennial problems</strong> related to how we have lost contact with the real universe, and it’s causing a crisis of sorts.</li>  <li>The <strong>realms of the head, heart, and hands</strong> are really useful places for a certain kind of conversation, but they aren’t up to the task of addressing the perennial problems.</li>  <li>We once had a thriving <strong>realm of mythology</strong>, but it was dismantled for parts after the previous wave of mythologies couldn’t keep up with other realms. But, we can still access it, once we delete everything in it first.</li></ol><p>Within the realm of myths, we have a few building blocks set up:</p><ol>  <li><strong>The Dark Forest</strong>, which grew from the seeds of all of our wicked problems that we can’t solve in the other realms.</li>  <li><strong>The Snake Egg</strong>, which was born from our own tension with the prospect of death, meaninglessness, etc.</li>  <li><strong>The Dialogue</strong>, between Snake and Forest, can now begin.</li></ol><p>The next step is have that dialogue and use the realm to make this tension between something and nothing, chaos and order, become real within the realm of my own personal myth. This post is just a scratch pad for the real artifacts that can be created in the realm of myths. The real work is to internalize the mythologies (sages, forest, and all) and to use that mode to better participate in the world’s problems and opportunities.</p><p>None of this is an easy ask, obviously.</p><p>I’m curious what others think of this so far. What are your thoughts <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jonbell\">Jon Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kev_mcg\">Kevin McGillivray</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@vickiheart\">Vicki Tan</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gplewis\">Geoff Lewis 🎨 ✍🏻</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@aaronzlewis\">Aaron Z.

Too weird? Not weird enough? Needs some salt?</p><hr /><h1 id=\"conclusion-take-this-away\">Conclusion: Take This Away</h1><p>The tldr is that we need new ways to address the perennial problems, and one of them that I see being most viable is to revive the mythic realm in a way that doesn’t challenge the strengths of the other realms. This will allow us to identify new salient possibilities (and motivations to act) via an epic story lens that are absent when we only try to address them with a scientific or economic lens, because solving these problems will never be cost-effective or practical in the moment.</p><p>This isn’t meant to be conclusive or authoritative on the meaning crisis or our response to it. Consider it a conversation piece that can be torn apart, forked and improved, played with, or ignored. The main point is to encourage participation in this conversation, because we can’t get anywhere without taking a few first stumbling steps.</p>",

View this post on Instagram           Monday morning I woke up without a client project for the first time in ten years. For most of my career, my goal was to build my client list. And that work paid off. Over the course of 11 years I’ve worked with over 80 clients. For most of the last decade, I loved client work. I loved the challenge of art direction, feedback and the back and forth toward something final. I loved working with art directors, who are mostly incredibly smart, hard working, kind people. I even grew to love a tight deadline. I feel so lucky that I got to work on so many incredible projects. But in the past few years I started to feel really tired and simultaneously disconnected from my own creativity. I have always made my own work amidst doing client work, so that wasn’t exactly the problem. I just wasn’t doing it with enough depth or any sense of abandon anymore because I didn’t have the time or energy. And I felt increasingly sad about that disconnect. Earlier this year I realized I needed — at least temporarily — to turn my attention back to my own process &amp; work, not just a little, but in full force. So with the exception of some book projects, I made a choice to stop making art for other people for awhile. This was not an easy decision. Client work is a huge part of my income. The relationships I have with some of my clients feel almost like family. Much of my own sense of success has been in direct relationship to the relative demand for my work, which has luckily been high. So if I stopped doing the thing I worked so hard at building over 10 years, who would I be? I started grappling with that question earlier this year. And I realized that my happiness, my connection to my well of creativity, was more important than my identity as a busy commercial illustrator. So I finished up the assignments I had before my vacation &amp; have stopped taking on new client projects. This summer &amp; fall I’m working on a couple books with generous timelines. I’ll continue to run my shops, teach &amp; speak . But I’m entering a new phase with enough space for exploration. And while I’m scared AF, I’m also ALL IN. Shaking things up feels good. ❤️ A post shared by  Lisa Congdon (@lisacongdon) on May 31, 2019 at 7:13am PDTThe phrase “all in” is really interesting to me, because it’s both exactly how I feel and also the opposite of how I feel. And this distinction is what fascinates me. How is it possible to go in “full force” while doing it “at least temporarily” and not trigger a paradox that destroys the universe?This year’s motto: All in &amp; with the flowTo be all in is to commit whole-heartedly to something. To go with the flow is to let the flow carry you where it may. To combine the two means to go all in with full force while it makes sense, and then to go all in with full force on the next thing that makes sense. And in order to do this there can’t be a lot of top-down structure in place limiting where force can be directed, or limiting where it can be redirected to. Maybe that’s creative freedom, and why it is tough to operationalize it in large structured groups like organizations, and why creative people need to exist in a loosely-connected interdependent sense with lots of people rather than participate in a rigid hierarchy optimized for efficiency and productivity at a specific task.ToolkitMy tool kit for being all in &amp; with the flow is:  Blog about non-professional things more (and write more newsletters)  Keep my beliefs up-to-date (be proactive rather than reactive)  Focus health-improvement on making it to my 100th birthday (a recent hypertension diagnosis is all the motivation I need)  Draw more (and don’t compare myself to other artists)  Don’t be afraid of selling things (I’m still afraid of selling things)  Build things that last (like 750 Words that turns 10 this year)  Keep dialogues open (I wrote a book about it, after all)  Reach out to people (independence requires interdependence)",

            "content_text": "I have a pretty weird story to share about my name.I was born with the name Erik Keith Benson.My parents told me that Erik is a Norse/Swedish name meaning king or something, loosely hand-waving to my father’s side of the family that is from there (though we have no known family that’s still over there). My mom said that the “k” was also convenient because it maps to the hard “k” sounds in Japanese. My first name in Hiragana is:  えりっくAnd is pronounced eh-ri–ku.Keith was my father’s middle name and my grandfather’s middle name, and my grandfather went by Keith. Another call out to that side of the family, but I don’t know if it had any significance past that. Looking it up on family search, none of my grandfather’s other 12 (!) siblings had the middle name Keith, and I don’t see it showing up in generations previous to that either. I remember some kid making fun of my middle name when I was super young… he said it was a nerdy or otherwise awkward name, and I often made fun of my own middle name for years, probably as a self-defense mechanism to that. It’s weird how that is still attached to my relationship with that name.And Benson also comes from my father’s side. I wish I had some connection to my mom in my name… that K at the end of Erik isn’t really a whole lot to go on. Benson was given to Sven “Swanty” Johan Bengtsson when he immigrated to the US on September 27th, 1875, having been converted by Mormon missionaries (I think).Now for the fun part.In 2006 I was feeling a little crazy and one night drunkenly decided to change my name for a year. As a vacation from my identity. I was feeling a bit stagnant, I guess, and needed to shake things up. So I asked a bunch of people to help me choose a new name to use for a year, and also tried to recruit friends to do it with me.It was fun to ask:  What would it be like to be John for a year? Or a Timothy?I was part of a startup that helped build goals called 43things.com at the time (it’s gone now), and I posted this question to everyone.  What’s the point of changing my name? Well, now that the goal’s on my list, the point is to cross it off my list. Everything on your list has a point – that’s the magic.And on September 6th, 2006 I drove to city hall with a polar bear (someone I had met at a show who also wanted to change her name, but who always wore a polar bear costume and went by the name Vladmir the Polar Bear) and flipped a coin in the courtroom to choose between the two final contestants for my last name: Butterfield and McLeod. It landed on McLeod, so I made Butterfield my middle name, and also changed my first name to Buster which had come to me in a dream. In the dream I had opened a cafe called Buster’s Cafe, and that seemed as legit a reason to use that name as any other I would ever come up with.After a few questions from the judge, who found the whole endeavor rather silly, my legal name became Buster Butterfield McLeod. And a few months later another friend who also changed her last name to McLeod started a bar and art gallery in Seattle named McLeod Residence. That’s a whole separate story, but when I got married to Kellianne a few years later neither of us wanted to use our current last names for various reasons and we decided to to back to Benson. And I changed my middle name back to Keith, but kept the first name.The name I have today, Buster Keith Benson, is partially from my parents and partially from a dream. There’s a whole lot more to this story as well, but it’s best told over a beer.",

But I also really like the original intended meaning and think it too is a phenomenon worth understanding.  The new usage of “emotional labor” has gained currency as a way to describe the myriad unpaid jobs and responsibilities that people (many of them women) take on in families, offices, and communities.  In families, the term refers to the mental work required to keep a household running—all that scheduling and bill-paying and research—as well as the anxiety of being in charge of those thankless and largely invisibly tasks.  “Emotional labor” had a narrower meaning as it was originally conceived. In 1983, the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild coined the term in her book, The Managed Heart, to describe a component of some service industry jobs in which workers must project a different emotion than the one they are experiencing. The most often used example of this is a flight attendant tasked with maintaining an air of friendly calm, even amidst passenger complaints or turbulence (a notion that inspired an entire genre of Saturday Night Live skits). It’s a useful term, to describe a real phenomenon.The original definition of “emotional labor” is the work of separating your public expression of emotions from your private experience of emotions. Wow.  When academic terms escape into the wilderness and take on new meaning, the concepts and arguments they describe meet a broader audience. Solomon points to the idea of “intersectionality” as another modern example.  But now, “intersectional” is often used in a positive sense as in: an intersectional approach to activism, or an intersectional outlook. It’s used to describe people working to be aware of the ways different identities overlap and intersect; and it has become shorthand for thinking outside your own experience of the world.The usage of “intersectionality” has evolved to include positive aspects as well as oppressive.  She pointed out that the most powerful, compelling terms and concepts hit upon something that needed a name.",

Solomon points to the idea of “intersectionality” as another modern example.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>But now, “intersectional” is often used in a positive sense as in: an intersectional approach to activism, or an intersectional outlook.

It has a more wishy-washy line about not harming people, but it&#39;s not central or primary to the oath.&mdash; Buster (@buster) January 17, 2019Click through for the rest.This is a modern re-write of the Hippocratic Oath which is the version most adopted by doctors today.  I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:  I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.Okay, it’s good to be humble and acknowledge the mountain of science that every doctor stands upon.  I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.This is my favorite line in the oath because it acknowledges that it’s necessary to always find the right balance here, and there’s no hard line around treatment or no treatment that a medical philosophy can rest on.  I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon’s knife or the chemist’s drug.Another caveat to our instincts to reduce everything to facts and theories. You gotta be a human as well.  I will not be ashamed to say “I know not,” nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient’s recovery.More humility. More acceptance of the fact that we’re all human.  I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.I’m starting to think that there’s a big problem with a lack of humility in the medical profession. But this is a good reminder. Doctors don’t know everything. Nor can they save everyone.  I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.Oh yeah, patients are humans too.  I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.But not as easy to take credit for. So another reminder to do things that get the outcome but avoid the credit, because they can be more effective.  I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.Yup, still a human!  If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.Enjoy life and leave the world better than you found it.",

This unfolding project has been the hardest and most rewarding work of my professional life so far.It seems necessary to put these ideas into practice towards something meaningful.

Like many these days, I live in a bubble.I think the best way to make it all feel less like a trap to conservatives and more like an opportunity to relieve some of our collectively built up frustration is to find a founding member with strong ties in conservative communities. I’m extremely interested in any intros to people you think might be a good fit for this.What is Fruitful?  It will be a Q&amp;A site with representation from every political and policy perspective we can find. There will be areas to “Ask a liberal person with who is pro-immigration” and “Ask a person who didn’t vote in 2016” and “Ask a person who believes Trump is doing positive things for our country” etc. It will focus on people more than groups because part of the problem is that you can’t understand a group, or talk to it… you can only talk to and understand individuals. There will be a code of conduct for how to ask questions and how to answer them, geared towards open-ended questions and generous listening. Our first chat will be “Ask a liberal Episcopal pastor” and we’ll try to do one every week. Every member will have a chance to express their worldview and invite curious and friendly inquiry.  We aren’t trying to change anyone’s mind. We’re trying to expand our perspectives to include how other people see things.  Imagine if we had a respectful, quiet, and friendly place on the internet to ask honest questions of people we don’t normally relate to.

But be warned, enumerating your own unstated basic beliefs was much harder than I thought it’d beVery true. We find that we have only glimmers of our own beliefs, and have to make them up more than discover them when we try to look for what they actually are.  That we have a particular kind of territory doesn’t mean we have to have a particular kind of map.

Thus, the structure and adoption of narratives shapes our collective worldviews and our societies, all the way up the chain from single words to full-blown paradigms.

You can find every change to every belief between 2012 and 2019 in this changelog.2012I listed about 40 beliefs the first time I sat down and tried to do this. Organized by subject, like “On Morality”, “On Science &amp; the Universe”, etc.2013It almost doubled in length in the second year to about 70 beliefs. It was still largely tracked on a subject basis.2014I added a bunch of stuff to the top and all around the beliefs to better explain the system of tracking beliefs over time and reviewing them frequently. I think I realized at this time just how valuable the project was to my own sense of well-being, and I hoped others would find it useful too. I also added a section for my “favorite ideas” because these too seemed to shift and grow over time in a way that was useful to occasionally review.2015I tried something new this year, and attempted to organize by beliefs by the type of belief they were instead of by their subject. I was really interested in understanding the structure of beliefs, and coming up with language to describe how beliefs were shaped in our brains, and how they served different functions. I think this is where I lost a lot of people… whereas before people would see the Codex and say “Wow, I want to make one” now they said “Wwow, that looks complicated. I could never do something like that.”2016I stuck with this system for another year, cleaning it up, trying to explain it better and make it feel less intimidating. I continued to add new beliefs and change old ones as well, with the count growing to around 115. But my interests had shifted a bit to cognitive which were one level deeper than beliefs.2017More shuffling, more cleaning up. But I think I saw the writing on the wall this year and realized that this new structure wasn’t going to hold where this needed to go.2018I refactored everything to come back to be organized by subject, but kept a bit of structure to separate beliefs that were about how I saw the world, and beliefs about how I thought the would should be. The first set includes beliefs that could potentially be proven wrong with new information, but the second set was more a matter of opinion. This turned out to be really useful in my continued exploration of biases and arguments, because this small difference in the belief makes a bit difference in how you form them, and how you talk about them.2019Starts tomorrow, in a new place (aka here). The subject categories have been cleaned up a bit more, and I’ve shifted to using tags (marked by emoji) to show how some beliefs are about information (🧠 the head), values (❤️ the heart), and strategy (✋ the hand). And I also added a 🔥 tag to any that are particularly sensitive to me, and an indicator for how confident I am in the belief (💪 or 🤞).We’ll see where it takes us.The image used in this post is the motto of “The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge”.

            "content_text": "This is my 13th year of yearly birthday reflections. Here are the previous 12:  41: Seek endarkenment  40: Mind the loops  39: Make wiggle room  38: Cultivate quality time  37: More kiloslogs  36: Talk it out  35: Love the struggle  34: Cultivating the core  33: Frugal to the max  32: No problem  31: Double down  30: Higher highs and lower lowsI usually do these on my birthday at the end of May, but it’s now July. Whoops. Most (okay, all) of my energy is going into 3 things right now and for the foreseeable future: family, work (Patreon), book. Book, by virtue of being the most flexible, is taking the 3rd rank there, and is therefore the most behind. Meaning that, given time to think and write, which this post generally requires, there’s usually a higher urgency need to work on the book directly. Hence the delay. That’s my story.But, I know that self-reflection of the past and coming year is fundamental to actually being a productive and healthy contributor to family, work, and the book… so here we are.One notable thing about all of this is that my 3 priorities are converging more than they ever have in the past. I’m looking back at the mottos from last few years: cultivate quality time (38), make wiggle room (39), mind the loops (40), and seek endarkenment (40)… these are all links in the same chain that now turns out to be a universal mindset that applies to family, work, and writing. I guess that’s a convenient byproduct of systems thinking… eventually it all has to fit together into a single puzzle.To be more specific.It probably goes back further. My multi-decade long love of private journaling, constraints, unfiltered streams of consciousness, quantified self, and self-reflection are all links in the chain too. I remember journaling in college, and then writing in LiveJournal, and then doing morning pages, 8:36pm, and most recently doing my “Written on Bart” series, slowly circling around a hunch that somewhere below my thoughts was an invisible, interconnected web of ideas and meaning that were more interesting than the things that happened to bubble up to the surface of my mind and personal narrative.Writing 50 posts in between the time BART’s subway doors closed at either Ashby or El Cerrito Plaza station, and when they opened in SF on Civic Center or Powell, was like taking a shovel and digging deeper and deeper into the unprocessed portions of my brain.My coworker, Ben, and I were designing a 1-hour discussion for our product/eng/design offsite a few months back. As we were brainstorming, he told the story of a teacher (if my memory serves me) who gave the class, or maybe just him, advice to “Dig deeper” on a particular topic or assignment. It has rung in my ears since… dig deeper! The problems and answers are not out in the world, they’re inside us. Since Trump was elected, I’ve been struggling with how to respond, how to even interpret what is happening in the first place… but as tempting as it has been to blame him and Nazis and evil-doers for the world’s problems, I keep returning to a mistake that I made… I had been overly optimistic about the direction of the world (I had even bet a friend that we would win the presidency as well as a majority in the Senate and the House)… how embarrassingly wrong I was. My optimism creates a blind spot around how the world actually was. And now the blind spot has grabbed the spotlight. Now, I grieve for my inaccurate assessment of the country and the world… it was never right, and by being inaccurate it allowed problems to fester. Cultural debt leads to culture wars. I had not dug deep enough to realize this at the time. Going forward, perhaps I could do better.Niko helps me dig deeper too. Seeing the world through a child’s eyes, where nothing makes sense yet, but giant open questions are opened and resolved on an almost daily basis made me realize how many ideas and mental models we have that are unexamined simply because there’s consensus on them. Because an authority figure (in this case me) gave a confident answer. As I learned to dig deeper, maybe I could help him build those skills early, so that not every confident authority figure he runs into can just insert answers into his brain without examination. How might that even work? I would have to dig deeper to find out.Maybe I could write a systems thinking children’s book? Incidentally, my first proposal to the editor and agent I am now working with was a “Little Prince meets Star Trek meets Who Moved My Cheese” space fable. It had the bonus quality of being the first idea that felt like it might unite family and writing priorities. 20 first chapters and book proposals later, I got a deal that seemed too good to be true! It’s no longer a space fable but it still unites family, and writing, and work too!But work (at Twitter, then Slack) remained unintegrated from the other direction, like the stubborn force of gravity that refuses to link up with the Grand Theory of Everything. How might work add value to writing?A few months later, Patreon floats past my view and I realize that’s the solution! Working with creators: podcasters, YouTubers, webcomic artists, illustrators, writers, and all manner of niche creative types who are also trying to unify their lives under a single Grand Theory! Gravity, however, remains unintegrated as far as I know.So yeah, this last year, I signed a book deal with Portfolio (an imprint of Penguin Random House) to write a book about arguing. Why arguing? Well, arguing is something that applies to every field of interest, and also pretty much every moment of every day. Family, work, craft, and self. To argue is to be human. Arguing is generally not considered to be quality time, except that sometimes, as if by freak accident, it creates the best quality time… conflict brings resolution. The heat of argument is not so different from the passion to live meaningfully. We argue because we care! Arguing makes us wiggle, and gets us nervous, and yet arguments are also sign posts for interesting conversations that we really should be having. Even if they aren’t the conversations we want to have. To be frank, we want to change other people, prove their idiocy wrong, shame their maliciousness, and silence their unproductive dissent. We’re motivated to confirm our own positions, and to ignore any evidence to the contrary. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same. We use zingers to keep our spirits up and taunt the enemy, and to get a laugh while stinging our enemies.That unproductive kind of arguing, and digging deeper, could not be more different in spirit and execution. But how to flip it to something productive? This has been my obsession this last year.Last year’s motto: seek endarkenmentEndarkenment is the opposite of enlightenment.If enlightenment is getting the answer, endarkenment is walking into the uncertainty of an open question. A dark room. If enlightenment is having all the evidence and data to prove that you’re right, endarkenment is the doubt of not knowing if you are right or if you just fear that you aren’t right and so are signaling confidence to brute force your way out of the problem.If enlightenment is the Obama presidency, endarkenment is the Trump presidency.If enlightenment is getting degrees, making money, setting up a matched 401K, angel investing, and getting invited to all the cool parties, endarkenment is wondering if you should opt out of the entire scene and move to a small island, and live with monkeys.Enlightenment is fighting for truth. Endarkenment is wondering if you’re even on the right side.It can get a bit dark. It’s endarkenment!Motto for my 42nd year: dig deeperThis is a continuation of my now 4-year interest into systems thinking, quality time, and cognitive biases. Jack posed a question on Twitter recently:What are the best books you’ve read on critical thinking? And why? https://t.co/iRMx0qGaGw&mdash; jack (@jack) June 29, 2018Lots of solid answers in the replies. Critical thinking and cognitive biases are my jam. Not because I’m any better at it than others, but maybe a little bit because I know how bad I am at it.Over a million people have now “read” my post that claims to be a cognitive bias cheat sheet. It’s been translated a bunch and used in classes, papers, and books all over the world. It’s weird, given that I just summarized a Wikipedia page. But it’s also not weird. The accidental secret to its success is that it takes advantage of all 4 bias categories:  There are several hundred cognitive biases (too many), so reducing them to 4 basic problems helps filter out the noise.  There’s no satisfying theory that unites all biases (not enough meaning), so I made one up that wasn’t “because brains suck” but a bit more friendly and forgiving “our brains are doing their darn best”.  Nobody actually has time to devote to immersing themselves in the nuances of biases, so now you can just bookmark this cheat sheet and share it with friends. Done.  Our attention and memories are like a school of baby penguins gripping a slippery sheet of ice in a category-5 hurricane. Even a bookmark is too hard to keep track of. Here’s a phone lock screen to hold onto as the waves of distractions constantly crash onto you.Asking for critical thinking tips on Twitter is a bit like having 24-hours left to live and spending it searching for a 1-day course on how to spend the last day of your life.It’s okay though.I don’t mean to pick on Jack, because we all do this. That’s the point! We’re all part of a wiggling universe that is extremely worried that it’s not good enough. We spend our last days on Earth looking for ways to signal to ourselves and others that we’ve at least put in sufficient time worrying about this problem. The hope being that we’ll then feel good enough, and give ourselves permission to do other more pleasant things.So when I say I want to dig deeper, it’s not to reach enlightenment. It’s to reach endarkenment, where I can appreciate being part of a universe that doesn’t think in terms of good enough or not, because obviously we all are. Instead I want to dig deeper in terms of appreciating the world as it is, grieving the loss of wishful thinking about how we wanted the world to be, and enthusiastically participating in the tiny patch that we find ourselves in, while we last. Maybe on a small island with monkeys. Maybe we’re already there.I love these monkeys. Some who can’t keep their pants up while bouncing on beds.Some who are quickly developing their own complex inner narratives of life on monkey island:And of course this lovely monkey I have enlisted to enthusiastically participate with most closely, approaching 10 years now:Family, work, book. These are the shadows cast by my life now past its 42nd year, the first year of life that extends further than my own father’s was able.“Everything we see is a shadow cast by that which we don’t see.” — Martin Luther King JrTo digging deeper, friends. 🍻",

Instead I want to dig deeper in terms of appreciating the world as it is, grieving the loss of wishful thinking about how we wanted the world to be, and enthusiastically participating in the tiny patch that we find ourselves in, while we last.

I wouldn’t have guessed that Medium would remain my publishing platform of choice for longer than all of the others (other than maybe LiveJournal, which extends back to at least 2002). But here we are! I’m thankful for Medium and am happy to be an early adopter of their new membership experiment. Long live Medium!In my Life by Weeks chart on busterbenson.com, two events stood out from the rest: Louie Phoenix Benson was born on August 6th, and Trump was elected on November 8th. They were quite different in terms of how I reacted to them. I also started writing a book about how to draw better conclusions while avoiding bias, and took on a lead role at Slack for the platform team.Last year’s motto: mind the loopsThe last year really was a lot about minding the loops. The now see feedback loops, and systems, and cycles everywhere I look.  In product development: What’s the right way to empower a messaging, communication, and workflow ecosystem to build businesses on other businesses? A system like this needs aligned incentives amongst a lot of different individuals, consistency, and trust.  In management: How can I mentor and manage people at different parts of their careers? A career is a learning, testing, and iterating system with many different phases, breaks, setbacks, opportunities.  In relationships: What’s the best way to be a good father to a newborn, and a 6 year old, and how can I be a good husband and partner? A relationship is a system with loops on many different time scales.  In creativity: What’s the best way to frame a creative project, like a book? Any form of exploration, discovery, and articulation is a system that requires a balance of seeking questions and answers, drafts and edits, proposals and agreements.It’s really true that the world isn’t linear — it’s loopy! But the loops are so intricate, often untraceable, and interdependent, that minding them is only enjoyable if I also let myself get lost in them a bit. I mind them in the same way I mind the stars, and long distances of space and time… appreciating the glimpses I get, but not really getting to the bottom of anything. A loop has no bottom.In the small glimpses I get, though, there’s a piece of the loops that has begun to stand out to me and it’s helped me understand why some systems are so difficult to understand or see. There’s often a stage within any system where things lose cohesion, or visibility, for extended periods. When a loop or a system gets tough to follow.  In the water cycle, water can get stuck in the ocean, or underground, for millennia before resurfacing and dancing through clouds, streams, animals, and plants.  In the life cycle, the part where we die and our bodies turn back into dirt, and that dirt spends hundreds or thousands of years working through the occasional worm digestive track, and each individual mineral or atom ends up in one of a billion different plants, animals, and geographic elements before dispersing again… that sort of makes the cycle difficult to follow and truly picture.Most cycles have a dark part. And darkness is generally not sought out, or invited into our explanations. We prefer ideas that sit nicely in an Occam’s Razor type of articulation. In the 4 conundrums model of how we understand the world, we filter out the dark parts of the world early and often.And yet. The dark part is so crucial. Without the vastness of empty space, everything would just be a giant ball of burning flames that crushed itself under its own weight. We need that darkness to create some sense of separation so that things can operate independently long enough to do something interesting. It’s only through extended separation that different species evolve. It’s only through the vast spaces between your brain and mine that we can think of each other as different people.And then there’s the darkness of the world. With Trump in power, the darkness feels a bit overwhelming, and it’s obviously natural to want this era of darkness to end. But the pressure of that darkness is the churning motivation that will fuel the next era, whatever that is.My father died in the same year of his life that I’m entering of my own right now. I’m still recovering from that, and still resist attempting to imagine what it must have been like to say goodbye to wife and a son and a daughter, not to mention goodbye to one’s self.This year’s motto: seek endarkenmentThink about it. The light is where everything is seen and understood (or where we at least think it is). Things make sense. There’s a shared understanding. A plan. But what do our eyes do in the light? Our pupils constrict. They narrow. And we get accustomed to the light and prefer to stay in it, where things are all figured out.On the other hand, the dark is where things can’t be seen. Especially when you’ve been in the light for a while. There is no plan. Nothing makes sense. But our pupils dilate and slowly adjust… there’s a seeking, a deep desire for exploration, curiosity, and we rely heavily on any tools or people around us to help us figure out what’s going on.If enlightenment is the desirable end state where everything has been brought into perfect clarity, endarkenment is the moment when we become comfortable in the darkness, in the lack of perfect clarity, when we’ve realize that we’re moving backwards, that we were wrong about a whole lot of things. Where we open our pupils, exposing ourselves to possible additional damage, but even so confidently seek the help of others because we need them.Even with everything going on in the world with Trump, and hate, and backwards progress, in the spirit of seeking endarkenment I feel like my only path forward is to accept that we messed up. We became so obsessed with progress, and advancement, that we didn’t get everyone on the wagon. Not by a long shot. A huge chunk of the world isn’t progressing, isn’t advancing, even amongst the people we have around us, and it’s our fault for leaving them behind. Instead of spending hours every day reading about the latest terrible thing Trump has done, let’s instead start thinking about how we begin to include the people who have had the same salary for 20 years, even while everything has gotten more expensive and more inaccessible. Let’s seek endarkenment on this and see where it goes.In the darkHere’s a some things I am a bit in the dark about at the moment, and am curious to see where they lead:  What kind of human will Louie grow into this year?  Is my book going to be any good? Am I going to make progress?  How will work culture and momentum continue to evolve?  What will happen to this country?  How can I enable improvement and better outcomes in the above things?  How do I make sure I stay healthy and happy and connected to the important people in my life along the way?It’s tempting to interpret discomfort in the dark as motivation to find the nearest answer. It’s a bit of an extension of the Spotlight Effect (where we only look for answers in areas that we feel clarity about). When we find ourselves in the dark, we assume the first answer/explanation we find is the right one. Instead, I’d like to sit in the dark a bit longer, let my eyes adjust a bit more, and wait for new information to slowly reveal itself, even if it’s quiet at first, and feels different than the answers I’m used to finding.To that end, I’m going to be spending a bit more time this year refactoring my codex. I’m testing having it hosted in a slightly more readable place in GitBook, which is pretty perfect for this use case.If you are interested in downloading my Book of Beliefs in an ebook format, you can let me know if this is useful at all by trying these links and letting me know how it goes: Kindle version, iBooks version.I think I’ve sufficiently over-engineered my yearly report post.

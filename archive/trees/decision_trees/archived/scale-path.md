## Introduction
This path will help you identify trees with small, scale-like leaves. These are evergreen trees with leaves that tightly overlap like roof shingles or fish scales. Scale-leaved trees are mostly in the cypress family and include cedars, junipers, and cypresses.

## How to Use This Path
1. Start at the first question below
2. Follow the path based on your answers
3. If you're not sure, try both paths or look for more clues
4. When you reach a tree name, use the "Confirmation Checkpoints" to be sure

Remember: Your senses of smell and touch are especially helpful for identifying scale-leaved trees!

## Identification Key

### Step 1: Leaf Arrangement
*How are the scale-like leaves arranged on the branches? This first split separates cedars (flat sprays) from junipers, cypresses, and redwoods (wrapped scales). This divides our 18 scale-leaved trees into groups of 9 and 9.*

#### 1A: Flat, Fan-like Sprays
*Scale leaves form flattened, fan-shaped arrangements*

Continue to [Flat Fan-like Sprays](#flat-fan-like-sprays)

#### 1B: Irregular/Wrapped Arrangement
*Scale leaves wrap around stems or form irregular patterns*

Continue to [Irregular/Wrapped Arrangement](#irregularwrapped-arrangement)

---

## Flat Fan-like Sprays

### Step 2-F: Foliage Fragrance
*How do the crushed leaves smell? This is one of the most reliable ways to distinguish between similar-looking cedars and cypress trees. This splits our 9 flat-sprayed trees into groups of 4 and 5.*

  - *Also called Eastern Arborvitae*

#### 2-F-B: Branch Appearance
*Examine the form of the branches*

Continue to [Branch Appearance](#branch-appearance)

## Branch Appearance

### Step 3-B: Branch Tip Form
*Do the branch tips droop distinctly? This helps distinguish certain cedars from others. This splits our 5 remaining flat-sprayed trees into groups of 2 and 3.*

#### 3-B-A: Drooping Branch Tips
*The ends of branches hang down noticeably*

- **Alaska-cedar** (Callitropsis nootkatensis)
  - *Distinctly drooping or weeping branch tips*

## Irregular/Wrapped Arrangement

### Step 2-I: Cone Type
*What kind of cones does the tree have? This helps separate junipers (berry-like cones) from other scale-leaved trees (woody cones). This splits our 9 irregular-scaled trees into groups of 2, 5, and 2.*

#### 2-I-A: Berry-like Blue or Red "Cones"
*Cones are fleshy, round, and berry-like (technically modified cones)*

## Woody Cones

### Step 3-W: Tree Size and Form
*How tall is the tree and what is its general shape? This helps distinguish the giant redwoods from other scale-leaved trees. This splits our 5 woody-coned irregular-scaled trees into groups of 3 and 2.*

#### 3-W-A: Very Tall Trees with Distinctive Features
*Among the tallest trees in the world when mature*

## Confirmation Checkpoints

Always confirm your identification by checking multiple features:

1. **Leaf Arrangement**: How are the scales arranged? Fan-like sprays or wrapped around stems?
2. **Smell**: Crush a small bit of foliage. Does it have a distinctive smell?
3. **Cones**: What type, size, and shape are the cones? Woody, berry-like, duck-bill shaped?
4. **Branch Tips**: Do they droop or grow upright? Are they soft or prickly to touch?
5. **Bark**: What color and texture is the bark? Fibrous, shreddy, plated?
6. **Tree Form**: What is the overall shape of the tree? Columnar, pyramidal, spreading?
7. **Location and Habitat**: Where is the tree growing? Is this typical for this species?

Remember that trees can vary based on age, growing conditions, and location!

## Seasonal Identification Tips

### Spring
- Look for bright green new growth at branch tips
- Pollen cones may release yellow pollen clouds when shaken
- On Dawn Redwood, watch for fresh light green scales emerging after winter dormancy

### Summer
- Foliage is fully developed and at typical color
- Good time to observe branching patterns and scale arrangement
- Young cones begin to develop but may still be green or immature
- Foliage typically darker green than spring growth

### Fall
- Minimal seasonal change in most scale-leaved evergreens
- Cones mature and may change color
- Dawn Redwood turns orange-brown before dropping scales
- Some species may show slight bronzing in cold weather

### Winter
- Most scale-leaved trees remain green year-round
- Mature cones often most visible after leaves of deciduous trees have fallen
- Dawn Redwood will be completely bare of scales
- Tree form is more visible, making overall shape easier to see

## Kid-Friendly Identification Tips

- **The Smell Test**: Gently crush a few scales between your fingers and sniff - Incense-cedar smells like pencil shavings!
- **The Touch Test**: Are the scale-covered twigs soft or prickly? Junipers are usually prickly, cedars are softer.
- **The Berry Hunt**: If you see tiny blue "berries" on a scale-leaved tree, it's probably a juniper (they're not really berries, but special cones).
- **The Giant Hunt**: Giant Sequoias and Coast Redwoods have spongy bark and are ENORMOUS when fully grown.
- **The Duck-Bill Game**: Look for cones that look like duck bills - that's Incense-cedar!
- **The Droopy Branch Check**: If branch tips hang down like they're sleepy, it might be Alaska-cedar or Western Redcedar.

**Smell Detective Game**: Each cedar and cypress has its own special smell. Try to learn them like a smell detective!
- Incense-cedar = pencil shavings
- Western Juniper = gin/spicy
- Western Redcedar = sweet and fruity
- Port Orford-cedar = resinous, spicy

**Winter Challenge**: Find the only scale-leaved tree that loses all its leaves in winter! (Dawn Redwood)

Remember to always respect trees when identifying them - don't break branches or peel bark just to identify them!

## Genus-Level Identification

To make this guide more accessible for kids ages 8-10, we've grouped some less common trees by genus. This helps focus on trees you're most likely to see in California while still teaching you how to recognize all tree types.

### Common Cypress Genus (Cupressus spp.)
*These cypress species share these family traits:*

- **Common Characteristics:**
  - *Scale-like leaves that form tight, overlapping patterns*
  - *Round, woody cones with a distinctive shield-shaped scales*
  - *Strong, often aromatic scent when foliage is crushed*
  - *Bark that often becomes fissured or fibrous with age*
  - *Typically have dense, compact foliage*

- **Includes 5 species:**
  - *Atlantic White-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides): Eastern native with blue-green foliage*
  - *Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana): Actually a juniper with blue berry-like cones*
  - *Italian Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens): Tall, skinny columnar form popular in landscapes*
  - *Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa): Wind-swept form native to central coast*
  - *Northern White-cedar (Thuja occidentalis): Also called Eastern Arborvitae, with flattened sprays*
  - *Port Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana): Graceful cedar with drooping branch tips*

- **Identification Tips:**
  - *First, identify it as a cypress by the scale-like leaves and round, woody cones*
  - *Italian Cypress is easily recognized by its very narrow, columnar shape*
  - *Monterey Cypress often has a distinctive wind-swept appearance, especially near the coast*
  - *Eastern Redcedar has blue berry-like cones rather than woody cones*
  - *Northern White-cedar and Atlantic White-cedar have flattened, fan-like sprays*
  - *Port Orford-cedar has graceful, slightly drooping branch tips and bluish-green color*

## Fun Facts About Scale-Leaved Trees

- The wood of Incense-cedar is what most wooden pencils are made from!
- Coast Redwoods are the tallest trees in the world, reaching over 370 feet high.
- Giant Sequoias are the most massive trees, with some weighing as much as 12 blue whales!
- Dawn Redwood was thought to be extinct until living trees were discovered in China in the 1940s.
- Western Redcedar bark was used by Native Americans to make clothing, baskets, and even canoes.
- The "berries" of junipers are used to flavor gin.
- Monterey Cypress naturally grows in only two small groves on Earth, both near Monterey, California.
- Many scale-leaved trees can live for thousands of years.

**Remember**: Scale-leaved trees are masters of survival! Their overlapping scales help them hold onto water, which is why many can grow in dry or windy places where other trees struggle.

# "What Catches Your Eye?" Tree Identification Guide

## Start Here: What's Most Distinctive About The Tree?

Look at the tree in front of you and ask yourself: "What's the FIRST thing I notice about this tree?"

```
What catches my eye about this tree?
│
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES look interesting! → [Go to Leaf/Needle Path](leaf-needle-path.md)
├── The CONES, FRUITS, or SEEDS catch my eye! → [Go to Cone/Fruit/Seed Path](cone-fruit-seed-path.md)
├── The FLOWERS catch my eye! → [Go to Flower Path](flower-path.md)
├── The BARK looks interesting! → [Go to Bark Path](bark-path.md)
├── The LEAVES or NEEDLES SMELL interesting when crushed! → [Go to Smell Path](smell-path.md)
├── The OVERALL SHAPE or SIZE stands out most! → [Go to Shape/Size Path](shape-size-path.md)
├── The TRUNK SHAPE or FORM is most distinctive! → [Go to Trunk Shape Path](trunk-shape-path.md)
└── The tree has NO LEAVES right now (winter deciduous tree) → [Go to Winter Detective Path](winter-detective-path.md)
```

## About This Guide

This kid-friendly field guide uses a "What catches your eye?" approach to tree identification, helping children ages 8-10 identify trees without specialized botanical knowledge. Follow the path based on what feature you notice first about the tree in front of you.

Each path will guide you through a series of choices based on observable features, ultimately leading to identification of genus and species.

## Special Features

This guide includes:
- **"I'm Not Sure" Options**: Help sections for when you're uncertain at decision points
- **Difficulty Ratings**: Star system (★, ★★, ★★★) to show which identifications are easier or harder
- **Seasonal Indicators**: Information about when certain features are visible
- **Cross-Navigation**: "What Else Can You See?" sections to try different paths if you get stuck
- **Reference Guides**: Educational materials that explain key concepts:
  - [Tree Shapes Guide](references/tree-shapes-guide.md): Common tree silhouettes and forms
  - [Branching Patterns Guide](references/branching-patterns-guide.md): How to tell opposite from alternate branches
  - [Bark Features Guide](references/bark-features-guide.md): Types of bark textures and colors
  - [Conifer Crown Guide](references/conifer-crown-guide.md): Understanding conifer tree shapes
  - [Leaf Types Guide](references/leaf-types-guide.md): Different leaf types, arrangements, and shapes

## Interactive Versions

In addition to the markdown-based paths, this guide is also available in interactive formats:

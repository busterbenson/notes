  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Tall, unbranched trees with a crown of large, fan-shaped or feather-like leaves at the top of a single trunk. Palms have fibrous trunks often covered with old leaf bases or distinctive ring patterns, and they produce clusters of small flowers followed by various types of fruits depending on the species."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Unbranched trunk with large, fan-shaped or feather-like leaves forming a crown at the top; no branches along trunk"
    secondary_markers: "Fibrous trunk often covered with old leaf bases or distinctive ring patterns; large leaf scars or 'boots' on trunk"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Tall tree with a single unbranched trunk and a crown of large leaves at the very top"
    memorable_comparison: "Palms look like a straight pole with a giant green umbrella or star at the top - they never have branches along the trunk like other trees"
    touch_tip: "Feel the trunk - it's often rough with a pattern of diamond shapes or old leaf bases"
    smell_tip: "Palm leaves don't have a strong smell, but when the trees flower, some have a sweet fruity scent"
    fun_fact: "Palms aren't actually trees like oaks or pines - they're more closely related to grasses! And the California Fan Palm is the only palm that's truly native to California. It grows in special desert spots called oases where there's underground water. Native Americans used every part of these palms - they ate the fruits, wove the leaves into baskets and roofs, and even used the fibers to make sandals and rope!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the overall shape - does it have a single, straight trunk with no branches and a crown of large leaves only at the top?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it has branches along the trunk, it's not a palm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they either shaped like a fan that's been folded like accordion pleats, or like a feather with many narrow leaflets?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are a different shape, it might be a different type of plant"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the trunk - does it have a pattern of diamond-shaped marks or old leaf bases attached to it (not smooth bark like other trees)?"
        yes_next: "You found a palm tree! If it has fan-shaped leaves and grows in the desert, it might be the California Fan Palm."
        no_next: "If the trunk has smooth or scaly bark like other trees, it's probably not a palm"

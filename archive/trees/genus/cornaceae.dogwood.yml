genus:
  common_name: "Dogwood"
  scientific_name: "Cornus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Cornaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Small to medium-sized deciduous trees or shrubs with showy white or pink floral bracts that appear like large flower petals. Dogwoods have distinctive opposite branching, leaves with prominent parallel veins that curve to follow the leaf margin, and produce clusters of small red or blue berries."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches that grow in pairs and large white 'flowers' that aren't really flowers"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches grow like arms reaching out in pairs, and what look like white flower petals are actually special leaves protecting the tiny true flowers in the center"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - run your finger along the veins that curve like arches following the edge of the leaf"
    smell_tip: "Dogwood flowers have a light, sweet fragrance in spring"
    fun_fact: "Dogwood trees play a trick on us! What looks like their pretty white or pink flowers aren't flowers at all - they're actually modified leaves called bracts. The real flowers are tiny and clustered in the middle. Also, their name doesn't come from dogs - it comes from an old English word 'dagwood' because their hard wood was used to make daggers and skewers!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at how the branches grow - do they come out from the trunk in pairs, directly opposite each other?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If branches alternate sides or spiral around, it's not a dogwood"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves - do they have curved lines (veins) that follow the edge of the leaf, like railroad tracks curving around a mountain?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the veins go straight to the edge or the leaf is divided into leaflets, it's probably not a dogwood"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In spring, look for large white or pink 'flowers' with four or more petal-like parts; in summer and fall, look for small red or blue berries in clusters"
        yes_next: "You found a dogwood! The size and shape can help you figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If it's not the right season to see flowers or berries, check winter twigs for opposite buds"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      identification_tips: "Distinctive large white or pink bracts make spring identification easy"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, dogwoods put on a beautiful show with big white or pink 'flowers' that look like stars against the forest"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full leaf development; green berries begin forming; bracts fall away"
      reproductive_activity: "Berries develop from pollinated flowers"
      identification_tips: "Opposite leaves with distinctive curved veins; developing green berries"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the white 'petals' are gone, and small green berries start to grow where the flowers were"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn reddish-purple before dropping; berries ripen to red or blue"
      reproductive_activity: "Berries fully mature; eaten and dispersed by birds"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive fall color; clusters of bright red or blue berries"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, dogwood leaves turn beautiful reddish-purple colors, and their berries ripen to bright red or blue like tiny little apples"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Maple (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maples have lobed leaves, not simple oval ones; produce winged seeds (samaras), not berries; lack the curved leaf veins"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are deeply lobed (like a hand) rather than oval, and the tree produces helicopter seeds instead of berries, it's a maple, not a dogwood"
    
    - species: "Viburnum (Viburnum species)"
      differences: "Viburnums have similar opposite branching but lack the distinctive curved veins; flowers grow in rounded clusters, not with large bracts"
      identification_tip: "If the flowers grow in rounded clusters without the large white or pink bracts surrounding them, it's likely a viburnum"
    
    - species: "Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis)"
      differences: "Redbuds have heart-shaped leaves with alternate arrangement; flowers grow directly on branches; has pod-like fruits"
      identification_tip: "If the flowers grow directly on the trunk and branches and the leaves are heart-shaped, it's a redbud, not a dogwood"

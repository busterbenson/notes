  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Small deciduous trees or large shrubs known for their spectacular pink to magenta flowers that bloom directly on branches before leaves appear in spring. All redbuds have perfect heart-shaped leaves with smooth edges and produce flat, papery seedpods."

    - name: "California Redbud"
      scientific_name: "Cercis occidentalis"
      distinguishing_features: "Smaller, more blue-green leaves; more drought-tolerant; usually grows as a multi-trunked shrub 10-20 feet tall"
      california_context: "Native to Sierra Nevada foothills and Coast Ranges; adapted to California's dry summers"
    
    - name: "Eastern Redbud"

      scientific_name: "Cercis canadensis var. texensis"
      distinguishing_features: "Glossier, often slightly thicker leaves; sometimes with wavy leaf margins"
      california_context: "Occasionally planted in gardens; native to Texas and neighboring states"
    
    - name: "Chinese Redbud"
      scientific_name: "Cercis chinensis"

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bright pink-purple flowers growing directly on bare branches in early spring; perfect heart-shaped leaves with smooth edges; flat, papery seedpods"
    secondary_markers: "Usually multi-trunked growth form; smooth gray bark on young trees; blue-green to green heart-shaped leaves"
    seasonal_markers: "Spring: spectacular pink-purple flowers on bare branches; Summer: heart-shaped leaves and developing seedpods; Fall: yellow to orange fall color; Winter: persistent seedpods, zigzag branches"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Katsura Tree (which also has heart-shaped leaves), Redbuds have alternate leaves (not opposite) and distinctive pea-like flowers; unlike Purple Leaf Plum, Redbuds have smooth-edged leaves and papery seedpods instead of fruits"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches covered with bright pink-purple flowers in spring before leaves appear, followed by perfect heart-shaped leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "In spring, it looks like someone hung tiny pink butterflies all over the branches; the leaves are shaped just like Valentine's Day hearts"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth, heart-shaped leaves - they're not fuzzy, just smooth like paper. The flat seedpods feel like thin paper too."
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell if you gently sniff them, but they're more special to look at than to smell"
    fun_fact: "The flowers grow right out of the branches and even the trunk, not just at the tips! This special way of flowering is called 'cauliflory' and makes it look like the tree is wearing a coat of pink butterflies in spring."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "In spring, do you see a small tree with bright pink-purple flowers growing directly on the bare branches?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's not spring, go to step 2. If it is spring and no pink flowers, not a redbud."
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they shaped exactly like a Valentine's heart with smooth edges (no teeth)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a redbud - check trees with different leaf shapes"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Do you see flat, papery pods that are green, reddish-purple, or brown, about 2-4 inches long?"
        yes_next: "You found a redbud! Check the size and leaf color to tell which type it might be."
        no_next: "If it's winter or early spring, check if it has multiple trunks and look for any remaining brown seedpods from last year"

    - name: "Flowering Dogwood (Cornus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Dogwoods have opposite leaves (not alternate), and what look like 'flowers' are actually modified leaves surrounding small true flowers"

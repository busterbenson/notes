genus:
  common_name: "Alder"
  scientific_name: "Alnus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Betulaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees that grow near water with toothed, oval leaves and distinctive small woody cone-like seed structures that remain on the tree year-round. Alders have smooth gray bark when young that develops rectangular plates with age, and produce hanging catkins in early spring before leaves emerge."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small woody 'cones' (actually seed structures) that stay on the tree year-round; grows near water; toothed oval leaves"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark often with white patches; catkins in early spring; leaf buds on short stalks"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Little woody 'cones' that stay on the tree all year, even in winter when the leaves fall off"
    memorable_comparison: "The tiny woody 'cones' look like miniature pinecones the size of your fingertip"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're slightly sticky or tacky to touch"
    smell_tip: "No strong smell, but the crushed leaves have a mild green scent"
    fun_fact: "Alders are super helpers in nature! Their roots have special bumps with bacteria inside that can take nitrogen from the air and put it in the soil like a natural fertilizer. This helps other plants grow better around them! They're also some of the first trees to grow back after a wildfire."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, is the tree growing near water, like a stream, lake or in a wet area?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not an alder - they almost always grow where it's wet"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for small woody 'cones' about the size of your fingertip on the branches. Can you find them?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If no 'cones' are visible but it's growing near water, check for cottonwood or willow"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves - are they oval or rounded with toothed edges (like tiny sawteeth around the edge)?"
        yes_next: "You found an alder! Check which kind by looking at the bark and leaf shape."
        no_next: "If leaves aren't oval with toothed edges, it might be another type of water-loving tree"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Long hanging catkins appear before leaves; new leaves unfold with reddish tint turning green"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release yellow pollen; female catkins develop into future 'cones'"
      identification_tips: "Early hanging catkins are distinctive; look for both male (long) and female (short) types"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In early spring, look for dangling 'caterpillar' tassels called catkins that hang down before the leaves come out"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of green leaves; woody 'cones' from previous year may still be present alongside new developing ones"
      reproductive_activity: "Female catkins slowly transform into woody 'cones'"
      identification_tips: "Look for sticky young leaves and both old and new developing cone-like structures"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the leaves are full and green, and you can see both old brown 'mini-cones' and new green ones growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow-brown before dropping; new woody 'cones' mature and turn brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed 'cones' mature but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Fall color not vibrant; presence of newly matured brown woody 'cones'"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is when the leaves turn yellowish-brown and drop, but the little woody 'cones' stay on the tree"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches with persistent woody 'cones'; next year's catkin buds visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed 'cones' may open and release seeds; new catkins begin to elongate late winter"
      identification_tips: "Woody 'cones' very visible on bare branches; catkin buds start to develop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter when the tree has no leaves, it's easy to spot the tiny woody 'cones' on the bare branches"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Birch (Betula species)"
      differences: "Birches have more papery or peeling bark; catkins that fall apart when mature rather than becoming woody; less association with water"
      identification_tip: "If the bark peels in paper-like layers and there are no woody 'cones', it's likely a birch, not an alder"
    
    - species: "Cottonwood/Aspen (Populus species)"
      differences: "Cottonwoods have more triangular or heart-shaped leaves; release cottony seeds rather than woody 'cones'; have flatter leaf stems that cause leaves to flutter"
      identification_tip: "If leaves flutter in the breeze and there are no woody 'cones', it's likely a cottonwood"
    
    - species: "Willow (Salix species)"
      differences: "Willows have longer, narrower leaves; produce cottony seeds; more flexible branches; no woody 'cones'"
      identification_tip: "If leaves are long and narrow like little canoes, and there are no woody 'cones', it's likely a willow"

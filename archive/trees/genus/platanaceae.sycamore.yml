  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Distinctive mottled bark that peels in patches revealing multiple colors (cream, tan, olive, brown); large maple-like lobed leaves; round, dangling seed balls"
    secondary_markers: "Massive, wide-spreading canopy; often growing near water sources; large trunk diameter"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Peeling, multi-colored bark that looks like military camouflage"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like a puzzle with pieces missing, showing patches of different colors underneath"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth in newly exposed areas; older bark feels rough and flaky"
    smell_tip: "Crushing the leaves might give a mild, fresh green smell, but not strongly scented"
    fun_fact: "Sycamores are sometimes called 'ghost trees' because their white patches of bark seem to glow in the moonlight!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - does it have a pattern of peeling patches with different colors (like cream, brown, and olive green)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a sycamore - check birch if it has white peeling bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves (if present) - are they large and shaped like a star with 3-5 broad lobes?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If leaves are similar but more pointy and opposite on the branch, check maple instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Do you see round, ball-shaped seeds hanging from strings, or large tree growing near water?"
        yes_next: "You found a sycamore tree!"
        no_next: "If the tree has the right bark and leaves but no seed balls, it's still likely a sycamore - they might just not be visible yet"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New leaves emerge with a fine fuzz; light green color; mottled bark pattern visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Small flowers develop but are not showy"
      identification_tips: "Young leaves unfold with fuzzy texture; tree may look 'leafy' but not fully filled out"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the light green fuzzy leaves just starting to grow"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy with large, maple-like leaves; mottled bark pattern visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Green seed balls develop, hanging from branches"
      identification_tips: "Massive, wide-spreading canopy; large leaves provide good shade"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Sycamores make great shade trees in summer with their big leaves and wide branches"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow-brown and drop; seed balls turn brown and become more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed balls mature and some begin to break apart, releasing seeds"
      identification_tips: "Brown seed balls hanging from branches; fall color less spectacular than maples"
      kid_friendly_tip: "When the leaves fall, you can see the round seed balls that look like Christmas tree ornaments hanging from the branches"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Leafless with very prominent mottled bark; persistent seed balls may remain"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; some seed balls remain on tree through winter"
      identification_tips: "Most distinctive in winter when bark pattern is highly visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Winter is the best time to see the amazing camouflage pattern on the trunk and branches"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Maple (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maple has opposite branching (sycamore is alternate); maple has winged 'helicopter' seeds (not balls); maple bark is not mottled"
      identification_tip: "Check how the branches grow - if directly opposite each other, it's maple not sycamore"
    
    - species: "London Plane Tree (Platanus × acerifolia)"
      differences: "This is actually a type of sycamore! Just a hybrid species with less deeply cut leaves than California Sycamore"
      identification_tip: "If in an urban setting with less deeply lobed leaves, it's likely the London Plane Tree variety"
    
    - species: "Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua)"
      differences: "Sweetgum has star-shaped leaves with more pointed lobes; spiky not smooth seed balls; bark is not mottled"
      identification_tip: "If the seed balls are spiky instead of smooth, it's sweetgum not sycamore"

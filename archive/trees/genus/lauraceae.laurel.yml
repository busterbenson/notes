  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Strongly aromatic leaves with peppery, eucalyptus-like scent when crushed; lance-shaped evergreen leaves; small yellowish flowers in clusters; olive-like fruits"
    secondary_markers: "Medium to large tree; smooth gray bark when young, becoming darker and furrowed with age; dense shade; leaves arranged alternately"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that smell like spicy mint or eucalyptus when crushed"
    memorable_comparison: "Sniff the leaves and they'll wake you up like smelling salts! It's like a natural nasal decongestant - sometimes called 'headache tree' because the smell can be so strong."
    touch_tip: "Gently crush a leaf between your fingers and carefully smell - the aroma is powerful and distinctive!"
    smell_tip: "The smell is like a mix of bay leaf (used in cooking), eucalyptus, and pepper"
    fun_fact: "California Laurel leaves are so strong-smelling that breathing them in can clear your sinuses instantly! Native Americans would use the leaves to treat headaches by crushing them and inhaling the aroma, but they'd also place leaves around stored food to keep insects away. The wood is beautiful for carving and was once called 'California Myrtle' - furniture made from it can be incredibly beautiful."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Pick a leaf (with permission), gently crush it, and carefully smell - does it have a very strong, spicy scent that might make you sneeze?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If there's no strong smell or a different aroma, it's probably not California Laurel"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they dark green, shiny, and shaped like a lance or elongated oval?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If leaves are a different shape or arrangement, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, look for small fruits that look like tiny green or purple-black olives"
        yes_next: "You found a California Laurel tree! Also called Bay Laurel or Pepperwood."
        no_next: "If it's not the right season for fruits, the leaf smell is your best identification clue"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis)"
      differences: "Bay Laurel has a milder culinary scent; shorter, broader leaves; smaller mature size; not native to California"
      identification_tip: "If the leaf smell is milder and more pleasant (like cooking spices) and the tree is smaller, it's likely Bay Laurel, not California Laurel"
    
    - species: "Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus species)"
      differences: "Eucalyptus has sickle-shaped leaves that hang vertically; different bark that peels in strips; different menthol-like scent; seed capsules instead of berries"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves hang down vertically and the bark peels in strips, it's eucalyptus, not California Laurel"
    
    - species: "Avocado (Persea americana)"
      differences: "Avocado has larger, less aromatic leaves; much larger fruits; typically cultivated rather than wild in California"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves have only a mild scent when crushed and the tree produces large avocado fruits, it's an avocado tree, not California Laurel"

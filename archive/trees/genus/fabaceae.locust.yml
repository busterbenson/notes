genus:
  common_name: "Locust"
  scientific_name: "Robinia spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees with compound pinnate leaves and thorns or bristles along branches. All locusts produce hanging clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers (white or pink-purple) and flat seed pods, and have nitrogen-fixing roots that improve soil."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Trees with rows of small oval leaves along stems and thorns or bristles at the base of each leaf stem"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like tiny green feathers, and the flower clusters hang down like bunches of sweet pea flowers"
    touch_tip: "Carefully feel the bark, but watch out for the sharp thorns or bristles on branches!"
    smell_tip: "In spring, smell the sweet flower clusters that hang like bunches of grapes"
    fun_fact: "Locust trees are nitrogen-fixing superheroes that make the soil healthier for other plants! Their wood is so strong and rot-resistant that fence posts made from Black Locust can last more than 100 years - longer than metal posts!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have rows of small oval leaflets along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a locust - check trees with simple leaves instead of compound ones"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check where the leaf stems meet the branch. Do you see thorns, short prickles, or bristly hairs?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a locust - look for other trees with compound leaves but no thorns"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's spring, check the flower color. Is it white or pink-purple?"
        yes_next: "You found a locust! White flowers mean Black Locust; pink flowers mean one of the other locust species."
        no_next: "If there are no flowers, look for flat seedpods like bean pods. These are typical of all locust trees."

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Honeylocust has smaller leaflets, large branched thorns on trunk and branches, and long twisted seed pods"
      identification_tip: "Honeylocust thorns grow directly from the trunk and are often branched like miniature antlers; locust thorns are only at leaf bases"
    
    - name: "Ash (Fraxinus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Ash trees have opposite compound leaves (not alternate) and produce winged seeds instead of pods; no thorns"
      identification_tip: "Check leaf arrangement - if leaves grow opposite each other (not alternating), it's likely an ash, not a locust"
    
    - name: "Kentucky Coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Has much larger compound leaves (sometimes doubly compound) with larger leaflets; no thorns; thicker seed pods"
      identification_tip: "Kentucky Coffeetree has much larger, broader leaflets and no thorns"
    
  cultural_ecological_notes:
    - "All locusts are members of the legume family and fix nitrogen in the soil"
    - "Black Locust wood is extremely rot-resistant and valued for outdoor uses"
    - "Flowers of all species provide important nectar for pollinators"
    - "Some species (especially Black Locust) can spread aggressively by root suckers"
    - "Seeds contain toxic compounds but are eaten by some wildlife"
    
  range_within_california:
    - "None are native to California but several are planted and sometimes naturalized"
    - "Black Locust is the most commonly planted, found throughout the state"
    - "Ornamental species with pink flowers are mostly found in cultivated settings"
    - "Most species adapt well to California's Mediterranean climate once established"
    - "Black Locust has naturalized in some disturbed areas and can spread aggressively"

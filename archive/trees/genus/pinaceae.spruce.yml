genus:
  common_name: "Spruce"
  scientific_name: "Picea spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Pyramid-shaped evergreen trees with sharp, stiff needles that grow singly around the twig and leave distinctive peg-like projections when removed. Spruces have hanging paper-like cones, often whorled branching that tends to be horizontal or slightly upturned, and bark that breaks into small scales or plates."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super prickly needles that grow all around the twig like a bottle brush"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles are like tiny swords that poke you if you grab them - they feel much sharper than fir or pine needles"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch a branch - the needles are very poky! Now try to pull a single needle off and look at the twig - you'll see a tiny woody peg where the needle was attached, like a little wooden toothpick sticking out"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle carefully to smell a fresh, strong pine-like scent"
    fun_fact: "Spruce wood is used to make many musical instruments, especially violin tops, guitar soundboards, and piano parts. The wood vibrates in a special way that makes beautiful sounds! Spruce trees can also live for hundreds of years - some of the oldest spruces were already growing when the first European explorers came to America."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree shape - does it have a Christmas tree pyramid shape with branches growing in rings around the trunk?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the shape is irregular or the branches don't grow in clear rings, check other evergreen trees"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully touch the needles - are they very sharp and poky, growing all around the twig like a bottle brush?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If needles are soft and flat, check fir trees; if they grow in bundles, check pine trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Try to gently pull off a needle and look where it was attached - do you see a small woody peg sticking out from the twig?"
        yes_next: "You found a spruce! The needle color and cone shape can help you figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If you don't see a woody peg where the needle was attached, it might be a different evergreen tree"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges as light green buds that develop into fresh needles; male pollen cones appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen release from small male cones; female cones begin developing"
      identification_tips: "Look for contrast between new light green growth and older needles; pollen may dust surfaces below trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, spruce trees grow fresh light green needle tips, and tiny structures release yellow pollen dust that can make you sneeze!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to match older ones; young green or purple cones develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Female cones grow larger but remain tightly closed"
      identification_tips: "Young hanging cones becoming more visible; uniform needle color"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can spot the young green or purple cones hanging down from branches - they start out small and pointing upward, then turn downward as they grow"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Cones mature and change color from green to brown; minimal needle color change"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature, scales begin to open to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Brown mature cones; some older interior needles may yellow and drop but tree remains green"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown and start to open their scales like little wooden flowers to let the seeds fly out"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; open brown cones may persist on branches or fall"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature makes identification easier when deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Spruces stay green all winter when many other trees lose their leaves, and you can often still see brown cones hanging from the branches"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Fir (Abies species)"
      differences: "Fir has flat, soft needles that don't prick when touched; when needles are pulled off, they leave round scars, not pegs; cones stand upright"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are soft and flat and leave flat round scars when pulled off, it's a fir, not a spruce"
    
    - species: "Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)"
      differences: "Douglas-fir has softer, flatter needles; cones have distinctive 3-pronged bracts; more flexible branches"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are soft and the cones have little mouse-tail bracts sticking out, it's a Douglas-fir, not a true spruce"
    
    - species: "Hemlock (Tsuga species)"
      differences: "Hemlock has flatter needles arranged in flattened sprays; drooping leader (top); more delicate appearance; tiny cones"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has a drooping top branch and the needles are arranged in flattened sprays, it's likely a hemlock"

genus:
  common_name: "Ash"
  scientific_name: "Fraxinus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Oleaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees with compound leaves arranged in opposite pairs along branches, giving a characteristic Y-shaped branching pattern. All ash trees produce winged seeds (samaras) that spiral through the air like helicopters, and most have grayish, furrowed bark."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Opposite branching pattern forming Y-shapes at branch tips; compound leaves with 5-9 leaflets; winged seeds that spin like helicopters"
    secondary_markers: "Grayish-brown bark with diamond-shaped furrows; buds arranged opposite each other on twigs; leaflets with toothed edges"
    seasonal_markers: "Spring: inconspicuous flowers before or with leaves; Summer: full green compound leaves; Fall: yellow to purple fall color and winged seeds; Winter: opposite buds and distinctive branching pattern"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches that grow in perfect Y-shapes with compound leaves on opposite sides"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like someone holding their arms up in a Y shape, and the seeds spin down like helicopter propellers"
    touch_tip: "Feel the twigs - they're sturdy and grow in exact opposite pairs, unlike most other trees"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they usually feel a bit leathery"
    fun_fact: "Ash trees make the best wood for baseball bats! About 75% of all baseball bats are made from ash because the wood is strong but flexes just enough to hit the ball really far!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at how the branches grow. Do they form perfect Y-shapes with branches growing directly opposite each other?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an ash - most trees have alternate branching where branches zigzag instead of forming Ys"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they compound (divided into 5-9 smaller leaflets along a central stem)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a maple, which also has opposite branches but simple leaves (except boxelder)"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seeds with wings (in summer and fall). Do they hang in clusters and spin like helicopters when they fall?"
        yes_next: "You found an ash tree! Check the number of leaflets and where it's growing to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If it's winter or spring with no seeds visible, check for opposite buds on twigs and diamond-patterned bark"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Small purplish or greenish flowers appear before or with new leaves; new compound leaves emerge"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom and release pollen; pollination occurs"
      identification_tips: "Flowers may be visible before leaf-out; opposite branching pattern is clear"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for small purplish flower clusters and the first feathery leaves unfurling"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of dark green compound leaves; winged seeds develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds grow and mature"
      identification_tips: "Fully developed opposite compound leaves; developing winged seeds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you'll see flat green seeds with wings forming in clusters"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to purple; seeds mature and begin to drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature and disperse, spinning as they fall"
      identification_tips: "Fall color and mature winged seeds are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn bright colors, and you can throw the seeds up to watch them helicopter down"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Trees lose all leaves; opposite branching pattern and buds clearly visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Opposite branching; stout twigs with opposite buds; sometimes persistent seeds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter with no leaves, you can easily see the branches forming perfect Ys with fat buds at the tips"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Maple (Acer species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Maples also have opposite branching but simple leaves (not compound), except for boxelder; maple seeds come in pairs, not clusters"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are simple (not divided into leaflets), it's a maple, not an ash"
    
    - name: "Boxelder Maple (Acer negundo)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Boxelder is the only maple with compound leaves; it has 3-5 irregularly toothed or lobed leaflets; seeds in pairs, not clusters"
      identification_tip: "Boxelder leaflets are often irregularly lobed; ash leaflets have more regular shapes with finer teeth"
    
    - name: "Elderberry (Sambucus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Elderberry is shrub-like with opposite compound leaves but produces berries, not winged seeds; has pithy stems"
      identification_tip: "If it's more of a shrub than a tree and has berry clusters instead of winged seeds, it's elderberry not ash"
    
  cultural_ecological_notes:
    - "Many ash species are important timber trees, valued for their strong yet flexible wood"

  range_within_california:
    - "Oregon Ash is the most common native ash, found primarily in northern California"
    - "Oregon Ash grows naturally in riparian areas, wetlands, and places with high water tables"
    - "Other ash species are planted as landscape and street trees throughout urban areas"
    - "Arizona Ash is sometimes planted in drier regions of Southern California"
    - "Green and White Ash are occasionally planted in parks and as street trees"

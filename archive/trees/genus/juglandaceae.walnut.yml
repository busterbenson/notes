  scientific_name: "Juglans spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Juglandaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees with compound pinnate leaves that have a distinctive spicy aroma when crushed. All walnuts produce round nuts with a green husk that turns brown-black at maturity, and they typically have rough, furrowed bark on mature trees."

  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound pinnate leaves with multiple leaflets along a central stem; round nuts with green husks that turn brown-black when ripe; distinctive spicy-aromatic smell when leaves are crushed"
    secondary_markers: "Rough, furrowed bark on mature trees; alternate leaf arrangement; yellow fall color"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Feathery compound leaves with many leaflets along a central stem, and round nuts that stain your fingers dark brown if you touch the outer covering"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like green feathers, and the ripe nuts are like little round sports balls wearing brown-black jackets that will stain your hands like permanent marker"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're a bit leathery, and if you gently crush one, your fingers will smell spicy like furniture polish"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently and sniff - the strong spicy smell is very distinctive and will help you identify any walnut tree"
    fun_fact: "Walnut trees make a special chemical that can stain your hands dark brown and is actually used to make wood stain and hair dye! This chemical also keeps many other plants from growing underneath walnut trees - it's like the tree's invisible forcefield!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they divided into many smaller leaflets arranged like a feather along a central stem?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a walnut - check trees with simple leaves or differently arranged compound leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently crush a leaf and smell it. Does it have a strong, spicy scent (like furniture polish)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a walnut - try checking trees with compound leaves but no strong smell"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for nuts on the tree or ground (in summer or fall). Are they round with a green or brown-black outer covering?"
        yes_next: "You found a walnut tree! Check the size of the tree and number of leaflets to figure out which kind."
        no_next: "If it's not nut season, check the bark - mature walnuts have rough, furrowed bark with deep grooves"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New compound leaves emerge; long hanging male catkins appear before or with new leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Male catkins release pollen; small female flowers develop at branch tips"
      identification_tips: "Hanging catkins and emerging compound leaves are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for long hanging 'green worms' (catkins) and new feathery leaves unfolding"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of dark green compound leaves; green round nuts developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Nuts grow inside green husks"
      identification_tips: "Fully developed compound leaves; green nuts becoming visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when you'll see green round nuts growing - they start the size of marbles and grow to golf ball size"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow; nut husks turn from green to brown/black and may split"
      reproductive_activity: "Nuts fully mature and fall to ground"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color; mature nuts with staining husks"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow and the nuts turn brown with dark coverings that can stain your hands"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Trees lose all leaves; distinctive branch pattern and furrowed bark visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"

  look_alikes:
    - name: "Hickory (Carya species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Hickories have similar compound leaves but produce different nuts with 4-sectioned husks that split cleanly; bark often shaggy or plated rather than furrowed"
      identification_tip: "Walnut leaves have a strong spicy smell when crushed; hickories don't. Walnut husks don't split into clean sections like hickory husks."
    
    - name: "Ash (Fraxinus species)"
      type: "genus"
      differences: "Ash trees have opposite leaves (paired across from each other) while walnuts have alternate leaves; ash produces winged seeds, not nuts"
      identification_tip: "Check leaf arrangement - if leaves grow opposite each other (not alternating), it's an ash not a walnut"
    
    - name: "Ailanthus (Tree of Heaven)"
      type: "species"
      differences: "Similar compound leaves, but ailanthus has a small gland at the base of each leaflet and has an unpleasant smell"
      identification_tip: "Crush a leaf - ailanthus has an unpleasant odor like rancid peanut butter, while walnut has a pleasant spicy smell"

    - "English Walnut widely cultivated throughout California's Central Valley for commercial nut production"
    - "Native species generally found in riparian areas, stream sides, and valley bottoms"
    - "Some species now have expanded ranges due to cultivation and naturalization"

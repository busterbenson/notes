genus:
  common_name: "Buckeye"
  scientific_name: "Aesculus spp."
  taxonomic_level: "genus"
  family: "Sapindaceae"
  
  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Deciduous trees or large shrubs with distinctive palm-shaped compound leaves having 5-7 leaflets arranged like fingers on a hand. Buckeyes produce showy upright clusters of flowers and distinctive smooth, round fruits with shiny brown seeds that resemble deer eyes (hence the name 'buckeye')."

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Hand-shaped leaves with 5-7 'finger' leaflets and shiny brown seeds in round cases"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like a hand with 5-7 fingers spreading out from the palm, and the seeds look like the shiny brown eyes of a deer (that's why they're called 'buckeyes'!)"
    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth, round fruit and the shiny seed inside (but remember not to eat it - buckeye seeds are poisonous!)"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a sweet, pleasant fragrance in spring"
    fun_fact: "California Buckeye trees do something strange - they often drop their leaves in the middle of summer while other trees are still green! This helps them save water during California's dry summers. Native Americans found creative ways to use buckeye seeds - they would grind them up, leach out the poisons, and then use them for food. They also used crushed buckeye seeds to stun fish in small streams, making them easier to catch!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - do they have 5-7 'finger' leaflets spreading out from a central point, like a hand?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If leaves are simple (one piece) or have leaflets arranged along a stem, it's not a buckeye"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the branches grow - do they grow in pairs opposite each other, not alternating sides?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If branches alternate sides, it's not a buckeye - check maple or other trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for round fruits with shiny brown seeds inside (in summer and fall), or clusters of white or yellowish flowers (in spring)"
        yes_next: "You found a buckeye! If it drops leaves in summer, it's likely California Buckeye."
        no_next: "If none of these features are present, check the season or look at other trees"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      reproductive_activity: "Fruits grow larger; pollinated flowers develop into green capsules"
      identification_tips: "Summer leaf drop in California Buckeye is distinctive; developing green fruits"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see the green round fruits growing, and California Buckeye might surprise you by dropping its leaves while other trees are still green"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Fruits mature and open to reveal shiny brown seeds; leaves turn yellow before dropping (if not already dropped in summer)"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruits split open; seeds drop to the ground"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive round fruits with glossy brown seeds highly visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the round fruit cases split open to show the shiny brown 'buckeye' seeds that look like deer eyes"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Maple (Acer species)"
      differences: "Maples have simple (not compound) leaves with similar palmate shape; produce winged seeds (samaras), not round capsules"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are single pieces (not divided into separate leaflets) and the tree produces helicopter-like winged seeds, it's a maple, not a buckeye"
    
    - species: "Poison Ivy (Toxicodendron radicans)"
      differences: "Poison ivy has three leaflets, not 5-7; is a vine or shrub, not a tree; produces whitish berries, not large capsules"
      identification_tip: "Buckeyes always have 5 or more leaflets, never just three, and grow as trees or large shrubs"
    
    - species: "Sweet Chestnut (Castanea species)"
      differences: "Sweet chestnuts have simple, toothed leaves arranged alternately; spiny (not smooth) fruit husks; multiple smaller seeds"
      identification_tip: "If the fruit has spines like a sea urchin and the leaves are single-bladed with toothed edges, it's a chestnut, not a buckeye"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, reddish-purple bark that feels cool like plastic"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like polished cherry wood and feels smooth and cool like plastic"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels surprisingly cool to touch, almost like touching plastic or metal"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell but might have a mild, pleasant scent"
    fun_fact: "The name 'manzanita' means 'little apple' in Spanish because the berries look like tiny apples. Many Native California tribes used the berries to make a sweet cider-like drink!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it smooth and reddish-purple like polished wood?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a manzanita - look for other trees or shrubs"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Touch the bark - does it feel surprisingly cool, almost like plastic?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be madrone or another tree with similar bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the overall size - is it usually more of a shrub or small tree rather than a tall tree?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be madrone, which grows as a large tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the leaves - are they small, stiff, and leathery?"
        yes_next: "You found a manzanita!"
        no_next: "Might be another plant with reddish bark"

      reproductive_activity: "Fruits fully develop"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive red-brown berries visible"

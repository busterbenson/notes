  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super tall trees with soft, reddish-brown bark that feels spongy"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark is like a soft, spongy puzzle made of reddish-brown pieces; Coast Redwood can grow taller than a 30-story building!"
    touch_tip: "Touch the bark gently - it feels soft and stringy, almost like the material stuffed inside pillows"
    smell_tip: "Smell the bark if you can reach it - it has a sweet, woody scent"
    fun_fact: "Redwoods are some of the oldest living things on Earth! Some Giant Sequoias were already growing when the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids more than 4,000 years ago. They can live so long because their thick, spongy bark protects them from fire and bugs!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the size - is it an extremely tall tree with a thick trunk?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's a smaller tree, it might be young or another type of conifer"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark - is it reddish-brown and soft-looking, almost spongy with long fibers?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the bark is gray, smooth, or has hard plates, it's probably another type of tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves - Coast Redwood has flat needle sprays like ferns, Giant Sequoia has tiny scale-like leaves, and Dawn Redwood has feathery needles that drop in fall"
        yes_next: "You found a redwood! Check which type based on the leaf shape and where it's growing"
        no_next: "If the needles grow singly, in bundles, or look different than described, check other conifer types"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges at branch tips, lighter green than older foliage; Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia remain evergreen; Dawn Redwood leafs out with bright green needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen released from tiny male cones; female cones begin developing"
      identification_tips: "Look for contrast between new light green growth and darker older foliage; pollen may dust surfaces below trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new growth at the branch tips - it looks fresh and soft compared to the older needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full foliage development; consistent green color; some cones visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones continue developing but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Look for the distinctive silhouette and full foliage; cones becoming more visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when redwoods create their own weather - they catch fog in their branches and drip water to the ground like rain!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia show minimal change; Dawn Redwood turns orange-brown before dropping needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones mature and may begin to open"
      identification_tips: "Dawn Redwood's fall color distinguishes it from other redwoods; mature cones visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia stay green, but Dawn Redwood turns orange-brown like a sunset before dropping its needles"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia remain green; Dawn Redwood loses all needles showing bare branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones may release seeds during winter months"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen nature makes Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia stand out; Dawn Redwood is bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia keep their green leaves, but Dawn Redwood loses all its needles and takes a nap until spring"

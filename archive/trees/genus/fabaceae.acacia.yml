  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "Trees with distinctive yellow puffball flowers and finely divided, feathery compound leaves. Commonly planted in California landscapes, especially coastal areas, with smooth gray bark and rounded canopies."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bright yellow fuzzy puffball flowers covering the tree in winter or early spring; feathery, finely divided compound leaves that look lacy"
    secondary_markers: "Smooth gray bark, often with vertical lenticels; flat seed pods; rounded crown shape"
    seasonal_markers: "Winter to early spring blooming with masses of yellow flower balls; green foliage year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Mimosa, Acacias have yellow flowers (not pink/purple); unlike Gleditsia (Honeylocust), they have smaller, more finely divided leaflets and no thorns"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Look for trees covered with fluffy yellow pom-poms for flowers"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like super-fine feathers, and the flowers look like tiny yellow cotton balls or fuzzy pompoms"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel soft and feathery - like a very delicate fern"
    smell_tip: "When the tree is flowering, you might notice a sweet honey-like smell"
    fun_fact: "In Australia (where most Acacias come from), they're called 'wattles' and are the national flower!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they feathery and delicate, made up of many tiny parts?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not an Acacia - try Mimosa or Honey Locust if the leaves are similar but less fine"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Do you see bright yellow fluffy ball-shaped flowers (or if no flowers, does it have smooth grayish bark)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the tree has pink fluffy flowers, it's probably a Mimosa tree instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the flowers scattered all over the tree in little round yellow puffballs (not hanging in chains)?"
        yes_next: "You found an Acacia tree!"
        no_next: "If the yellow flowers hang in chains, it might be a Golden Chain Tree"

    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Consistent green foliage; seed pods developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Flat seed pods mature and turn brown"
      identification_tips: "Identified primarily by its feathery compound leaves and developing pods"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for the super-feathery leaves that look like delicate green feathers"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Remains green; may have mature seed pods"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pods fully mature and may begin to open"

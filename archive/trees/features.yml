# California Tree Identification Features
# This file organizes features for identifying trees in California
# Used as input for generating a kid-friendly decision tree

# FEATURE METADATA
# Each feature includes:
# - id: Unique identifier code (format: CATEGORY-SUBGROUP-NUMBER, e.g., LEAF-SHAPE-01)
# - description: What the feature describes
# - reliability: How consistent this feature is for identification
# - seasonal_visibility: When this feature can be observed
# - age_dependency: Whether feature varies with tree age
# - notes: Additional helpful information
# - visibility: How easy it is to observe (1=obvious from distance, 4=requires close inspection)
# - safety: Interaction guidance (look, touch-safe, smell-safe, caution, avoid)

# ORGANIZATION BY OBSERVATION DISTANCE
# Features are organized by how children naturally observe trees in the field

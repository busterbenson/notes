# Genus Update Project Summary

## Overview

Added structured genus information to all 174 tree files in the California trees collection. Each tree file now includes:

- `scientific_genus`: Extracted from the scientific name (e.g., "Pinus" from "Pinus ponderosa")
- `common_genus`: The common name for the genus (e.g., "Pine" for "Pinus")

## Accomplishments

1. **Developed Genus Extraction System**
   - Created functions to reliably extract scientific genus from binomial nomenclature
   - Built a comprehensive mapping system for scientific to common genus names
   - Handled complex genus classifications like oaks (White Oak, Live Oak, Black Oak)

2. **Preserved File Structure**
   - Maintained indentation and formatting of all YAML files
   - Added new fields seamlessly after scientific_name field
   - Used regex for precise insertion points

3. **Implemented Quality Assurance**
   - Created test scripts to validate changes before full implementation
   - Generated detailed reports of all updates
   - Added special handling for edge cases

4. **Added Complete Genus Coverage**
   - Mapped all 57 scientific genera to their common names
   - Researched and applied proper common genus names for all species
   - Updated "Unknown" genus values with accurate information

## Statistics

- Total tree files processed: 174
- Scientific genera identified: 57
- Most common genera:
  - Acer (Maple): 16 species
  - Betula (Birch): 13 species
  - Abies (Fir): 11 species
  - Pinus (Pine): 10 species
  - Quercus (Oak): 9 species

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses a two-step approach:

1. **Extraction Phase**
   - Parse scientific name to extract genus
   - Identify the appropriate common genus using mapping dictionary

2. **Insertion Phase**
   - Add fields with proper indentation
   - Update "Unknown" values when better mappings are available
   - Preserve existing values to avoid duplications

## Genus Mapping Highlights

Created mappings for all 57 genera, including:

- Simple mappings (e.g., Pinus → Pine)
- Complex mappings with species-based subgroups:
  - Quercus (Oak) → White Oak, Live Oak, Black Oak based on species
  - Populus → Aspen, Cottonwood, Poplar based on species

- Specialized cases:
  - Distinguished "True Cedar" (Cedrus) from other cedar types
  - Handled taxonomic updates (e.g., Notholithocarpus for Tanoak)
  - Mapped uncommon genera like Callitropsis, Morella, Sapindus

## Tools

The project used custom Python scripts:
- `add_genus_info.py`: Core extraction and mapping functions
- `add_genus_to_all.py`: Main processing script
- `test_genus_add.py`: Testing and validation

All scripts and the final report are preserved in the `scripts/genus_update` directory.

- `reformat_tree_files.py`: Match formatting to reference file style
- `reformat_tree_files_v2.py`: Improved reformatting script
- `reformat_tree_files_direct.py`: Direct structure reformatting

## Styling Scripts

- `add_blank_lines.py`: Adds blank lines before section headers
- `add_quotes_to_values.py`: Adds quotes to all string values
- `fix_feature_spacing.py`: Fixes spacing in feature sections
- `fix_features_complete.py`: Comprehensive feature section formatting

## Usage

These scripts were used in the initial formatting of the tree files and should not normally need to be run again. They are preserved for reference and in case similar formatting tasks are needed in the future.

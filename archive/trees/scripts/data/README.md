# Tree Project Data Files

This directory contains data files used by various scripts in the tree project.

## Files

- **all-trees-in-california-2025-03-23.csv**: Original dataset of California trees with taxonomic information
  - Used as a reference for tree names, scientific classifications, and other metadata
  - Date in filename (2025-03-23) indicates when the dataset was created or last updated

## Usage

These data files serve as inputs to various scripts in the project. They should be treated as read-only reference files to ensure data consistency.

The main tree files (YAML format) in the project root directory are generated or updated using these data files as reference.

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Pink pea-like flowers and leaves made of many little leaflets; sticky, hairy twigs that feel like they have glue on them"
    memorable_comparison: "The sticky twigs feel like they've been coated with maple syrup, and the pretty pink flowers look like sweet peas growing in clusters"
    touch_tip: "Carefully feel the young twigs - they're sticky like they have maple syrup on them! But watch out for the small thorns on the branches"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a sweet scent in spring"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called 'Clammy' Locust because of its sticky twigs and seedpods - 'clammy' means sticky or damp to the touch. The stickiness comes from tiny hairs that produce a glue-like substance that can catch small insects!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaves. Are they made up of many small oval leaflets (like 11-25) along a central stem?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the tree has simple leaves (just one leaf blade), it's not a locust tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully touch a young twig or seedpod. Does it feel sticky, like it has syrup or glue on it?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the twigs aren't sticky, check for Black Locust which has white flowers and isn't sticky"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's spring or early summer, look for flowers. Are they pink to purple and hanging in clusters?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it has white flowers, it's likely Black Locust; if no flowers are visible, check for thorns and sticky seedpods"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small thorns at the base of leaves or on branches. Can you find them?"
        yes_next: "You found a Clammy Locust!"
        no_next: "It might still be Clammy Locust with less noticeable thorns - check the sticky twigs and pink flowers again"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "A small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a narrow, spire-like shape and short, bluish-green needles. It has distinctive small, roundish cones that stay on the tree for many years, and thin scaly bark with a grayish-black color that gives the tree its name."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Short bluish-green needles that grow singly from the twigs; small, round-oval purple-brown cones that stay on the tree for years; narrow spire-like shape"
    secondary_markers: "Needles are square in cross-section and can be rolled between fingers; thin scaly bark with dark grayish-black color; often grows in boggy or wet areas"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change as it's evergreen year-round; new growth appears as lighter green in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike White Spruce, has shorter needles and smaller cones that remain on the tree longer; unlike firs, has square (not flat) needles and hanging (not upright) cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small Christmas tree shape with short blue-green needles and tiny round purplish-brown cones that stay on the tree for years and years"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a skinny Christmas tree wearing lots of little round earrings (the cones) all over its branches"
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the needles - they're short and stiff, and if you roll them between your fingers, they'll spin because they're square instead of flat"
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a needle to smell a fresh, piney scent that's not as strong as some other evergreens"
    fun_fact: "Black Spruce can grow in places that are frozen most of the year! It can survive in areas so cold that the ground stays frozen under the surface even in summer (called permafrost). It's one of the northernmost trees in North America - like a tree superhero with cold superpowers!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Is it narrow and spire-like, almost like a tall, skinny Christmas tree?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's wide or has a rounded shape, it's probably not a Black Spruce"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they short (shorter than your pinky finger nail) and bluish-green?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needles are long or bright green, it's probably a different spruce or conifer"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Try rolling a needle between your fingers. Does it roll easily (because it's square)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If it doesn't roll easily because it's flat, it might be a fir rather than a spruce"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for small round-oval cones that hang down. Are there lots of small cones, some of which look old and weathered?"
        yes_next: "You found a Black Spruce! The persistent cones that stay on for years are a great clue."
        no_next: "If there are no small, old cones visible, it might be another spruce species - check the bark to see if it's dark and thin with small scales"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges at branch tips as light green, eventually darkening; small purple-red female cones and yellow male pollen cones may appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin to develop"
      identification_tips: "New growth lighter in color at branch tips; possible pollen release from male cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green new growth at the tips of branches - like the tree is getting a fresh green manicure!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Needles all reach mature bluish-green color; new cones turn from purplish to brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones continue to mature"
      identification_tips: "Uniform blue-green color; developing cones becoming woody"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, all the needles are the same dark blue-green color, and you can see new little brown cones growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen; older cones may begin to open and release seeds"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones begin to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "No seasonal color change helps distinguish from deciduous trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees change color in fall, Black Spruce stays the same dark blue-green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No major change; may collect snow on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Narrow spire shape and short needles distinctive against winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the narrow shape helps it shed snow, and you can still see all those little round cones hanging on the branches"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "White Spruce (Picea glauca)"
      differences: "White Spruce has longer needles (up to 1 inch); larger cones (1-2.5 inches) that fall after seeds are released; often grows in drier sites"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has larger cones and longer needles, and doesn't keep old cones on the branches for years, it's likely White Spruce"
    
    - species: "Norway Spruce (Picea abies)"
      differences: "Norway Spruce grows much larger; has much longer needles and very large cones (4-7 inches); more pendulous branch tips"
      identification_tip: "If it's a large tree with long drooping branches and big cones, it's probably Norway Spruce, not Black Spruce"
    
    - species: "Red Spruce (Picea rubens)"
      differences: "Red Spruce has longer yellow-green needles; larger cones; reddish bark and twigs; typically grows in well-drained mountain soils"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are yellowish-green rather than bluish and the twigs have a reddish tint, it's likely Red Spruce"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with rows of small oval leaves along stems and thorns at the base of each leaf stem"
    memorable_comparison: "The thorns are like guards protecting each leaf, and the bark looks like twisted ropes stuck together"
    touch_tip: "Carefully feel the bark's deep grooves, but watch out for the sharp thorns on branches!"
    smell_tip: "In spring, smell the sweet white flower clusters that hang like bunches of grapes"
    fun_fact: "Black Locust wood is so strong and rot-resistant that fence posts made from it can last more than 100 years! Early American settlers used to say 'a locust fence post will outlast the hole it stands in.'"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have rows of small oval leaflets along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Black Locust - check trees with simple leaves instead of compound ones"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check near where leaf stems meet the branch. Do you see paired thorns? (Be careful not to touch them!)"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Black Locust - look for other trees with compound leaves but no thorns"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it deeply grooved with ridges that look like twisted ropes?"
        yes_next: "You found a Black Locust! If it's spring, look for hanging clusters of white flowers that smell sweet."
        no_next: "If the bark is smooth or scaly, it might be a different kind of tree. Check for seed pods in summer or fall."

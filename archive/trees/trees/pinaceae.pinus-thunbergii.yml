  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A striking ornamental pine native to Japan and Korea, with distinctive dark gray-black bark, bright green needles, and an artistic, often twisted growth habit. Widely used in Japanese gardens and bonsai, it's also salt-tolerant, making it valuable for coastal landscaping."
  
  # Identification path

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with dark gray-black bark and bright green needles that grow in pairs"
    memorable_comparison: "It looks like an artist painted a pine tree with fancy twisty branches and super dark bark - almost like it's wearing a black tuxedo while its bright green needles stand out like decorations!"
    touch_tip: "The needles are stiff and a bit sharp - be gentle when touching them. The bark feels rough and ridged."
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently between your fingers to release a fresh, piney scent."
    fun_fact: "Japanese Black Pines are super popular for making bonsai - those tiny trees that people grow in special pots! Artists carefully wire and prune them to make them look like miniature versions of ancient trees that might grow on a windswept cliff. Some bonsai Japanese Black Pines are over 100 years old but still tiny enough to fit on a table!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark - is it distinctively dark gray to almost black?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Japanese Black Pine - most other pines have brown or reddish bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the needles. Are they bright green and growing in pairs (exactly 2 needles attached at the same point)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Japanese Black Pine - check other pine species that match the needle arrangement"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the shape of the tree. Does it have an interesting, often irregular or artistic growth pattern?"
        yes_next: "You found a Japanese Black Pine!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Japanese Black Pine, especially if it's young or was pruned to be more symmetrical"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Dramatic 'candles' of new growth appear with distinctive white or silvery appearance"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "White 'candles' at branch tips are distinctive; contrast of new and old growth"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for what gardeners call 'candles' - the new baby branches growing from the tips that look like white fingers reaching up!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles; uniform bright green appearance"
      reproductive_activity: "Young female cones continue developing"
      identification_tips: "Uniform bright green needles contrast with dark bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the white 'candles' have grown into new green needles, and the tree is a beautiful bright green with super dark bark"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little color change; some older interior needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature"
      identification_tips: "Dark bark and evergreen nature make fall identification straightforward"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, some of the oldest needles near the trunk might turn yellow and fall off, but most of the tree stays bright green"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Distinctive dark silhouette; silvery-white winter buds visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; mature cones may remain on tree"
      identification_tips: "Dark bark, winter buds with silvery-white scales, and overall form are key winter identifiers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, Japanese Black Pine stands out with its dark branches against the sky, and you can see silvery-white buds where new growth will appear in spring"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium to large deciduous tree with opposite, 3-5 lobed leaves that have serrated edges and often reddish stems. True to its name, it produces red flowers in early spring, has red twigs, and typically turns brilliant red in fall. Its winged seeds spin like helicopter propellers when they fall."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "3-5 lobed leaves with serrated edges; reddish leaf stems (petioles); brilliant red fall color"
    secondary_markers: "Opposite leaf arrangement; red flowers in early spring before leaves emerge; smooth gray bark on young trees"
    seasonal_markers: "Red flowers in early spring; red leaf stems in summer; bright red fall color; red buds and twigs visible in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Silver Maple, has less deeply cut leaves; unlike Norway Maple, lacks milky sap when leaf stem is broken; unlike Sugar Maple, typically shows red (not orange) fall color"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with 3-5 pointed lobes and red stems"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaf shape looks like a hand with 3-5 fingers, and the stem holding it is often red like a cherry popsicle"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly rough because of their tiny teeth along the edges"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but fresh green leaves have a mild, pleasant scent"
    fun_fact: "Red maples are usually the first trees to change color in fall - they're like the leaders of the fall color parade!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the leaves grow on the twigs. Do they grow directly across from each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Red Maple - their leaves always grow opposite each other"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Does it have 3-5 pointed lobes (like a hand with 3-5 fingers)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Red Maple - check other trees with opposite leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaf stem (petiole). Is it reddish, especially when the leaf is young?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be another maple - Red Maples typically have reddish stems"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Are the leaf edges toothed or serrated all around (not smooth)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Red Maple!"
        no_next: "Not a Red Maple - their leaves have toothed edges"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum)"
      differences: "Silver Maple has more deeply cut leaf lobes with silvery-white undersides and very long leaf stems; typically has less vibrant fall color (usually pale yellow)"
      identification_tip: "Flip the leaf over - Silver Maple leaves flash silvery-white underneath, while Red Maple undersides are pale green or whitish but not silvery"
    - species: "Norway Maple (Acer platanoides)"
      differences: "Norway Maple has broader leaves with fewer teeth; produces milky sap when leaf stem is broken; has yellow fall color; seeds spread at 180-degree angle"
      identification_tip: "Break a leaf stem - Norway Maple will leak white sap, Red Maple won't; Norway Maple leaves are also wider with less serrated edges"
    - species: "Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum)"
      differences: "Sugar Maple leaves have smoother (not serrated) spaces between the points of the lobes; typically has yellow-orange fall color; buds are more pointed"
      identification_tip: "Look at leaf edges between the main points - Sugar Maple has rounded, smooth notches, while Red Maple has notches with tiny teeth all along the edge"
    - species: "Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum)"
      differences: "Japanese Maple is a much smaller tree; has more delicate leaves with deeper cuts and often 5-7 lobes; many varieties have red or purple leaves all season"
      identification_tip: "Japanese Maples are small, delicate trees with much fancier, star-like leaves that often have 7 lobes instead of 3-5"
    
  seasonal_timeline:

    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of medium to dark green leaves with reddish stems"
      reproductive_activity: "Winged seed pairs (samaras) develop and mature"

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves change to brilliant red, sometimes with orange or yellow"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds drop and disperse with wind"

      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, Red Maples really earn their name! Their leaves turn bright red - like stop signs growing on a tree!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches with red buds and reddish twigs"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds prepared for spring"

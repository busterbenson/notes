  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Large, shiny, deeply-cut leaves with bristle tips on the points"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like big hands with pointy fingers, and they turn Halloween colors (orange and gold) in fall"
    touch_tip: "Feel how thick and shiny the leaves are - they're tough like leather"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a mild oak scent, like a forest after rain"
    fun_fact: "California Black Oak acorns were super important food for Native Americans, but they had to leach out the bitter-tasting tannins first. They did this by crushing the acorns and rinsing them many times with water in special sand basins. These oaks can live as long as 500 years - that's about 7 human lifetimes!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they big (about as long as your hand) with deep cuts creating pointy lobes with little bristles at the tips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a California Black Oak - check other oak trees with different leaf shapes"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Does the tree lose all its leaves in winter? In fall, do the leaves turn golden or orange?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a California Black Oak - check evergreen oaks that keep their leaves year-round"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it dark (blackish-brown) and deeply grooved, like dark puzzle pieces?"
        yes_next: "You found a California Black Oak! If it's fall, look for acorns with deep, scaly cups."
        no_next: "If the bark is lighter colored or smoother, it might be a different type of oak"

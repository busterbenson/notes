  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A deciduous oak with distinctive blue-gray leaves that have rounded lobes. The bark is light gray and shallowly furrowed, and the tree often has a broad, rounded crown perfect for shade."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-gray leaf color; rounded leaf lobes without bristle tips"
    secondary_markers: "Light gray bark with shallow furrows; acorns with shallow, warty cups"
    seasonal_markers: "Leaves drop in late fall; new blue-gray leaves emerge in spring; acorns mature in one year each fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Valley Oak, has smaller, blue-gray leaves with less deeply cut lobes; unlike Black Oak, has rounded lobes without bristles"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the leaf color. Are they a dusty blue-gray color instead of bright green?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Blue Oak - check other oak species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Do the leaves have rounded lobes with no pokey tips?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the lobes have bristles at the tips, it might be a Black Oak instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, look for acorns. Are they about an inch long with a shallow, warty cup?"
        yes_next: "You found a Blue Oak!"
        no_next: "If the acorns are different, or if the leaves are much bigger with deeper lobes, it might be a Valley Oak"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

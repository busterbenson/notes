  # Basic summary
  summary: "A distinctive evergreen tree with a perfect pyramid shape and silvery-blue needles that stick out stiffly around the twigs. It has orange-brown bark that flakes into thin scales, hanging cylindrical cones, and sharp, pointed needles that have a distinctive blue color often visible from far away."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Striking silvery-blue needles that stick out all around the twig; symmetrical pyramid shape; sharp, stiff needles that are painful to the touch"
    secondary_markers: "Needles that are square in cross-section and can be rolled between fingers; cylindrical hanging cones 3-4 inches long; orange-brown flaky bark"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change as it's evergreen year-round; new growth appears at branch tips in spring as lighter blue-green"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike other spruces, has distinctly bluer needles; unlike firs, has painful pointed needles and hanging (not upright) cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Blue needles that stick out all around the twig and are super sharp - like blue hedgehog spikes all over the tree!"
    memorable_comparison: "The tree looks like it's been painted with blue-silver paint, like the silvery tinsel on a Christmas tree"
    touch_tip: "Be very careful! These needles are the sharpest of all spruces. Gently touch the side of a needle instead of the pointy end."
    smell_tip: "Carefully crush a needle to smell a strong, fresh evergreen scent that might remind you of Christmas trees"
    fun_fact: "Blue Spruce is Colorado's state tree! Its blue color comes from a special waxy coating that helps protect the tree in harsh mountain weather - like the tree is wearing its own sunscreen and raincoat all in one!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's color from a distance. Does it have a distinctive silvery-blue color that stands out from other evergreens nearby?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's dark green without blue coloring, it's probably a different type of spruce or fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree shape. Is it a nearly perfect pyramid shape with horizontal branches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it has a different shape, like a rounded top or drooping branches, it's probably not a Blue Spruce"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "CAREFULLY touch the needles (don't grab them). Are they very sharp and stiff, almost like they could poke through your glove?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the needles are soft or not painful to touch, it's probably a different evergreen tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Try rolling a needle between your fingers. Does it roll easily (because it's square)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Blue Spruce! The combination of blue color, sharp needles, and square shape is a perfect match."
        no_next: "If it doesn't roll easily because it's flat, it might be a fir rather than a spruce"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth emerges at branch tips as light blue-green buds that expand into new needles; pollen cones may appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin to develop"
      identification_tips: "Look for lighter colored new growth at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for the tips of branches turning a lighter blue-green color as new needles grow"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "All needles reach mature silvery-blue color; young cones are light green to purplish"
      reproductive_activity: "Young female cones continue to develop"
      identification_tips: "Blue color most vibrant; developing cones visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the blue color really stands out and you might see young green or purple cones growing"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen; cones mature to light brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and begin to open, releasing seeds"
      identification_tips: "No seasonal color change; mature brown cones visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees change color in fall, Blue Spruce stays the same blue color, and its cones turn brown"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No major change; snow may collect on branches highlighting the blue color against white snow"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Blue color often stands out more against winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, the blue color looks even more magical against the snow, like a blue and white castle"

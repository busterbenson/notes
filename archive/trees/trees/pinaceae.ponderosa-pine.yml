  # Basic summary
  summary: "The Ponderosa Pine is a tall evergreen tree with long needles in bundles of three and reddish-orange to yellow puzzle-piece bark that smells like vanilla or butterscotch. It has prickly cones and can grow to over 200 feet tall, making it one of the most important pine trees in western forests."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles in bundles of three; puzzle-piece bark pattern in orange-brown or yellow-orange colors; vanilla/butterscotch smell in bark cracks"
    secondary_markers: "Reddish-orange to yellow puzzle-piece bark; cones with sharp, outward-pointing prickles that feel painful when touched"
    seasonal_markers: "Little seasonal change; stays green year-round; yellow pollen in spring; cones mature in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Jeffrey Pine, has sharp prickly cones that hurt when touched (Jeffrey Pine cones are gentler); unlike Sugar Pine, has needles in threes not fives; unlike Knobcone Pine, has larger cones that fall off the tree"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Orange-brown puzzle piece bark and prickly cones"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like puzzle pieces in different shades of orange, brown and yellow"
    touch_tip: "Be careful touching the cones - their prickles are sharp and can poke your fingers!"
    smell_tip: "Sniff in a crack of the bark (don't scratch it) - you might smell vanilla, butterscotch, or sometimes turpentine"
    fun_fact: "The bark of older Ponderosa Pines can smell like vanilla or butterscotch cookies! The Ponderosa Pine is sometimes called the 'Yellow Pine' or 'Western Yellow Pine' because of its yellowish bark and wood."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, count the needles in a bundle. Do you find exactly 3 needles growing together in each group?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Ponderosa Pine - if there are 5 needles per bundle, check Sugar Pine; if 2 needles, check other pines"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark on the trunk. Does it have a pattern that looks like puzzle pieces in yellow, orange, or reddish-brown colors?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Ponderosa Pine - check other pine trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Find a cone on the tree or ground. CAREFULLY touch the prickles - do they feel sharp and poke your finger?"
        yes_next: "You found a Ponderosa Pine!"
        no_next: "If the prickles are soft and don't hurt, it's probably a Jeffrey Pine"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears, often slightly lighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small purple-red pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth and yellow pollen release"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, new needles grow and the tree makes yellow pollen that blows in the wind like dust"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles reach full size, color darkens; young seed cones growing"
      reproductive_activity: "Young seed cones continue developing, remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Green developing cones visible, about the size of a small apple"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Baby cones are growing in summer - they're green and have sharp prickles"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles yellow and fall; cones begin to ripen and open"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature, turn brown, and open to release seeds with wings"
      identification_tips: "Look for open or opening brown cones with seeds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones turn brown and open up to let their seeds fly away with little wings"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree remains green; empty opened cones may persist"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive form and bark visible; opened cones may persist on branches"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Ponderosa Pines stay green when other trees lose their leaves"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized pine tree native to California's mountains that's known for its specially adapted cones that stay closed for years. It has needles in bundles of three and cones that often grow directly on the trunk and main branches."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Needles grow in bundles of three; cones grow directly on the trunk and main branches and stay attached for many years"
    secondary_markers: "Cones are asymmetrical with knobs on the outer side; trees often grow in dense stands after fires"
    seasonal_markers: "Minimal seasonal change as an evergreen; new growth in spring appears as lighter green 'candles'"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Bishop Pine, has needles in threes rather than pairs; unlike Ponderosa Pine, has smaller cones that remain closed and attached to the tree for many years"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A pine tree with needles in groups of three and cones that grow right on the trunk and stay there for years"
    memorable_comparison: "The cones look like tiny pineapples with pointy bumps that grow right out of the tree trunk like buttons on a coat"
    touch_tip: "Gently feel the needles - they come in bundles of three, like a three-finger handshake"
    smell_tip: "Carefully sniff the needles for a fresh pine smell (don't crush or break them)"
    fun_fact: "Knobcone Pine is a fire superhero! Its cones stay tightly closed and stuck to the tree for up to 50 years, waiting for a forest fire to come along. When fire heats up the cones, they pop open and release their seeds, so new baby trees can grow in the freshly cleared soil. It's like they have fire-proof seed vaults!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the needles. Do they grow in bundles of 3 (exactly three needles connected at the base)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Knobcone Pine - if there are 2 needles per bundle, check Bishop Pine; if 5 needles, it might be Sugar Pine"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the cones on the tree. Do you see cones growing directly on the trunk or main branches that have stayed attached for years?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might not be a Knobcone Pine - check Ponderosa Pine which has cones that fall off after dropping seeds"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the cones. Are they pointy with little knobs on each scale and do they stay closed instead of opening to drop seeds?"
        yes_next: "You found a Knobcone Pine!"
        no_next: "Not sure? Look for trees growing in groups in sunny spots, especially on mountain slopes where there might have been a fire in the past"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as light green 'candles' at branch tips; male pollen cones produce yellow pollen"
      reproductive_activity: "Male cones release pollen; female cones begin development"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth at branch tips and small yellow pollen cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green 'candles' growing at the tips of branches - these will become new needles"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles mature to darker green; developing cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones grow larger but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Young cones are greenish-purple, turning woody and brown by late summer"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the new needles have grown out and small green or purple baby cones start to form"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Little visible change; some older needles may yellow and drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones continue to mature but remain closed"
      identification_tips: "Older needles may drop, creating a layer of needle litter beneath tree"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is quiet time for Knobcone Pine - it stays green while other trees change color or lose leaves"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "No significant changes; remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Evergreen form stands out when deciduous trees are bare; persistent closed cones remain visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its green needles when other trees lose their leaves"

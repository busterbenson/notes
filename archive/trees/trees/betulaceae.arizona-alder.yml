  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Grows right next to streams in the mountains, with smooth gray bark"
    memorable_comparison: "Its little woody 'cones' look like tiny baby pinecones, but they grow on a tree with regular leaves!"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - it's smoother than most trees, almost slippery when wet"
    smell_tip: "The bark has a fresh, earthy smell if you gently scratch and sniff it"
    fun_fact: "Alder trees are super helpers! Their roots have special bacteria that put nitrogen in the soil to help other plants grow better - like natural fertilizer!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where you are. Are you near a stream or water in the mountains?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not likely Arizona Alder - they love to have their feet wet!"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it fairly smooth and gray, not rough or deeply cracked?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not Arizona Alder - look for a tree with smoother bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaves (in spring/summer). Are they oval-shaped with slightly wavy edges?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Could be another kind of water-loving tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for tiny cone-like fruits about the size of your pinky fingernail. Do you see any on the branches or ground below?"
        yes_next: "You found an Arizona Alder!"
        no_next: "If it's spring, look for hanging catkins instead. If it's winter, check for small cone-like fruits on branches."

  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A rare and distinctive spruce tree known for its graceful, weeping branchlets that hang down like curtains. The dark green needles have two white lines underneath, and the tree produces long, narrow cones that hang from the drooping branches."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Distinctive drooping branchlets that hang down like curtains; dark green needles with two white stripes underneath"
    secondary_markers: "Short needles arranged in brush-like clusters; slender, hanging cones 3-6 inches long"
    seasonal_markers: "New growth appears in spring; cones mature by fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Engelmann Spruce, has dramatically drooping branches; unlike hemlocks, has needles all around the twig (not in a flat plane)"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Branches that droop down like a weeping willow, but with evergreen needles"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a Christmas tree that's crying or wearing long, droopy curtains"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel slightly prickly but not too sharp, and the branches hang down so low you can touch them"
    smell_tip: "Crush a needle gently to release a mild, fresh evergreen scent"
    fun_fact: "Brewer Spruce is one of the rarest trees in North America and grows almost nowhere else in the world except the mountains of northern California and southern Oregon!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the tree's shape. Do the branches droop down dramatically like a weeping willow or curtains?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Brewer Spruce - look for a different kind of spruce or fir"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the needles. Are they dark green, short (about 1 inch), and grow all around the twig (not just on the sides)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Brewer Spruce - if needles are flat and only grow on sides of twig, it might be a hemlock"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Turn over a needle. Does it have two white stripes on the underside?"
        yes_next: "You found a Brewer Spruce!"
        no_next: "Check for slender cones about 3-6 inches long, which would confirm Brewer Spruce"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New, lighter green growth appears at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny purple-red female cones form; yellow pollen cones release pollen"
      identification_tips: "Look for contrast between new growth and older needles"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches get bright new baby needles that look like tiny green stars"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth darkens to match older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones grow larger and change from purple-red to light brown"
      identification_tips: "Developing cones become more noticeable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, the baby cones grow from tiny purple things into longer brown ones"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and open to release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Mature cones with open scales are visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the cones open up like pine cones to let their seeds fly out in the wind"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Evergreen foliage may collect snow, making the drooping branches even more dramatic"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Hanging branches with snow are especially distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, snow piles up on the drooping branches making them droop even more"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii)"
      differences: "Engelmann Spruce lacks the distinctive drooping branches; has bluish needles; grows at higher elevations"
      identification_tip: "If branches stick out rather than hang down like curtains, it's likely an Engelmann Spruce"
    
    - species: "Mountain Hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana)"
      differences: "Mountain Hemlock has flatter sprays of needles, shorter cones, and a drooping top leader"
      identification_tip: "If needles are arranged in a flattened pattern and the tree top droops over, it's probably a hemlock"

  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, greenish-white bark and round leaves that tremble in the slightest breeze. Known for its flattened leaf stalks that cause the distinctive leaf movement, bright yellow fall color, and ability to grow in colonies from connected roots."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Round leaves that tremble in light wind; smooth, greenish-white bark with diamond-shaped dark marks"
    secondary_markers: "Flattened leaf stalks; trees often growing in connected groups; straight, slender trunk"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright yellow fall color; catkins before leaves appear in spring"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Very similar to Quaking Aspen but with slightly larger leaves; unlike birches, has no peeling bark; unlike cottonwoods, has smaller, rounder leaves"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Round leaves that dance and flutter even in the gentlest breeze"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like tiny green dinner plates that never stop wiggling and dancing in the wind"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth and cool like paper, and the leaf stalks are flat like tiny ribbons"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but new buds in spring can smell a bit sweet"
    fun_fact: "European Aspens are super social trees! They can grow a whole family of trees all connected underground by their roots. When you see a group of aspens with similar size, they might all be brothers and sisters from the same parent plant!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth and greenish-white with dark diamond shapes on it?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, peeling, or dark brown, it's probably not a European Aspen"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they round with small teeth around the edges?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaves are long, pointy, or have deep lobes, it's not a European Aspen"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Watch the leaves when there's a breeze. Do they tremble and flutter noticeably even in very light wind?"
        yes_next: "You may have found a European Aspen! (It looks very similar to Quaking Aspen, so it's hard to be sure without more experience)"
        no_next: "If the leaves stay mostly still in light wind, it might be a different type of tree"

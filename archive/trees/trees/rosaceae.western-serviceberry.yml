  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "White spring flowers like tiny stars followed by purple-black berries in summer"
    memorable_comparison: "In spring it's covered with clouds of little white star-shaped flowers, then in summer it transforms to make juicy purple-black berries that look like wild blueberries"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly fuzzy on the bottom side like soft animal ears"
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell in spring - take a gentle sniff like you're trying to catch a flower's whisper"
    fun_fact: "People who lived here long ago mixed these berries with meat to make a special traveling food called pemmican that wouldn't spoil all winter! Birds and bears love these berries so much that they sometimes eat the entire year's crop in just a few days, having their own berry festival."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "In spring, does it have bunches of small white flowers that look like stars?"

        no_next: "If it's summer, check if it has small purple berries that look like blueberries"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves - are they oval-shaped with tiny notches along the edges, especially toward the top of the leaf?"
        yes_next: 3

      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is it a bush or small tree (shorter than a house) with smooth grayish bark?"
        yes_next: "You found a Western Serviceberry!"
        no_next: "Might be another bush with white flowers - check the bark and size"

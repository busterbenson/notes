  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "An evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are green on top and golden-fuzzy underneath. The bark is gray and smooth on young trees, becoming thick and furrowed with age."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Leaves with golden or silvery fuzz on the underside; thick, leathery leaves that stay on the tree year-round"
    secondary_markers: "Acorns with thick, fuzzy cups that almost look like little bowls; gray bark that becomes furrowed with age"
    seasonal_markers: "New leaves appear in spring with extra golden fuzz; acorns mature in fall over 2 years"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Live Oak, has yellow-golden fuzz on leaf undersides rather than whitish; leaves are not as spiny on the edges"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, pick up a leaf and flip it over. Does it have gold or silver fuzz on the bottom side?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Canyon Live Oak - check other oak species"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Is it oval with a pointed tip, and do the edges have no spines or just a few spines?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a Coast Live Oak if it has lots of spiny edges"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In fall, look for acorns with thick, fuzzy or warty cups. Are the cups like little fuzzy bowls?"
        yes_next: "You found a Canyon Live Oak!"
        no_next: "Check the trunk - Canyon Live Oaks have gray bark that gets grooved as they age"

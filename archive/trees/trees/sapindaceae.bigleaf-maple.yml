  # Basic summary information
  summary: "The largest maple in North America, with huge, five-lobed leaves that can grow as big as a dinner plate. It has a thick, rounded crown, and in wet areas, its bark is often covered with moss."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Very large maple leaves with five deep lobes; leaves grow opposite each other on the branches"
    secondary_markers: "Pale yellow-green flowers hang in clusters in spring; paired winged seeds (helicopter seeds) in summer and fall"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright yellow to orange fall color; flowers appear in early spring before full leaf-out"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Much larger leaves than other maples; grows larger and only native maple in most of its California range"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super big maple leaves - bigger than your face!"
    memorable_comparison: "Leaves look like giant five-pointed stars or hands with five fingers"
    touch_tip: "Feel how big and soft the leaves are - they can be as big as dinner plates!"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf to smell a sweet scent (but don't tear it off the tree)"
    fun_fact: "Bigleaf Maple can grow moss gardens on its branches in rainy areas! Some trees have so much moss growing on them that small plants and even tiny salamanders live up in the tree branches like it's their own apartment building!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the size of the leaves. Are they huge (bigger than your hand) with five pointy sections?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Bigleaf Maple - check other maple trees with smaller leaves"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check how the leaves grow on the branches. Do they grow in pairs, directly across from each other?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Bigleaf Maple - check trees with leaves that alternate along the branch"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's fall, are the leaves turning yellow or orange? In spring or summer, can you find helicopter seeds growing in pairs?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bigleaf Maple!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Bigleaf Maple, but check the bark - it should be grayish-brown with grooves"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Leaves emerge bright green; hanging clusters of yellow-green flowers appear before leaves fully develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom and are pollinated by wind and insects"
      identification_tips: "Look for hanging flower clusters and fresh light green leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bunches of small greenish-yellow flowers hanging down like little chandeliers"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Leaves reach full dark green color; winged seed pairs develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds continue to develop throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Fully developed large leaves create dense, shady canopy; paired helicopter seeds visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you'll see the helicopter seeds growing in pairs - they're not ready to fly yet!"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to orange; winged seeds mature and spin to the ground"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds ripen and fall from tree, spinning as they descend"
      identification_tips: "Bright fall color stands out; mature seeds spinning down like helicopters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is helicopter season! Watch the seeds spin down from the tree like little whirlybirds"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree loses all leaves, showing its branching pattern"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; new buds prepare for spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for opposite branching pattern and large buds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can see the branches clearly - notice how they grow in pairs, facing each other"

    - species: "Sycamore (Platanus species)"
      differences: "Sycamore has alternate (not opposite) leaf arrangement and round, dangling seed balls instead of winged seeds"
      identification_tip: "Check how leaves grow - if they're not directly across from each other, it's not a maple"

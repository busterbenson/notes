  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A majestic evergreen conifer native to mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, reaching heights of 150-200 feet. Distinguished by its silvery-white underside of needles, cylindrical upright cones, and smooth gray bark that becomes fissured with age."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat, dark green needles with two silvery-white bands on undersides; needles arranged in a comb-like pattern along branches"
    secondary_markers: "Upright cylindrical cones (4-6 inches long); smooth gray bark on young trees that develops fissures and becomes grayish-brown with age"
    seasonal_markers: "Fresh light green growth in spring; cones mature from greenish to brown and disintegrate on the tree in fall"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Flat needles with silvery-white stripes underneath like tiny racing stripes"
    memorable_comparison: "The needles are arranged like the teeth of a comb on the branches"
    touch_tip: "The needles feel soft and flat, not pokey, and you can bend them without breaking"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a needle to smell a sweet, Christmas tree-like scent"
    fun_fact: "European Silver Firs can live for over 500 years - that's older than the United States! In Europe, they grow so tall that you'd need to climb 15-20 stories to reach the top of the biggest ones."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Are they flat and arranged in neat rows along the sides of the branches like a comb?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a European Silver Fir - try another conifer"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Turn over a branch. Do the needles have silvery-white stripes underneath?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a European Silver Fir - check if it might be another fir species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look up high in the tree during summer or fall. Can you see tall, cylinder-shaped cones standing straight up on the branches?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might still be a European Silver Fir, but check the bark - is it gray with shallow grooves on older trees?"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Is the tree growing in a botanical garden, park, or ornamental landscape in California? (Not growing wild in a forest)"
        yes_next: "You found a European Silver Fir!"
        no_next: "European Silver Firs aren't native to California, so they're usually only found where people have planted them"

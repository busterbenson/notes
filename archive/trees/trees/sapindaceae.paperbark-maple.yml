  summary: Paperbark Maple is a small to medium-sized ornamental tree prized for its striking cinnamon to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. This deciduous tree features trifoliate compound leaves (three leaflets per leaf) that turn brilliant orange to scarlet red in fall. Native to central China and considered vulnerable in the wild, it's planted in California gardens as a specimen tree valued for its year-round ornamental qualities, particularly its distinctive exfoliating bark.

    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it peeling in thin, papery layers with cinnamon to reddish-brown color?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Paperbark Maple - check birch trees if the bark is white and peeling"
      
      - step: 2

  wildlife_value: 
    - "As a non-native ornamental tree in California, Paperbark Maple doesn't have the same ecological relationships with local wildlife as native species"
    - "The seeds may be eaten by some birds and small mammals"
    - "Can provide nesting sites for birds, especially in urban settings where native options may be limited"
    - "Its dense canopy offers shelter and perching spots for various bird species"
    - "While it doesn't support as many insect species as native maples, it still contributes modestly to urban biodiversity"

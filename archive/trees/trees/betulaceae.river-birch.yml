  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A medium-sized tree with striking reddish-brown to cinnamon-colored bark that peels in curly, papery layers. The leaves are triangular to diamond-shaped with tiny double teeth along the edges, and the tree often grows with multiple trunks."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Reddish-brown to cinnamon-colored bark that peels in curly, papery strips; often has multiple trunks"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Reddish-brown bark that peels in curly ribbons like cinnamon rolls"
    memorable_comparison: "The bark looks like curly ribbons or peeling cinnamon sticks"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels papery and can peel off in thin sheets, but be gentle!"
    smell_tip: "The bark doesn't have a strong smell"
    fun_fact: "This tree is called River Birch because it loves to grow near water! It's tough enough to handle flooding, which would kill many other trees."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it a cinnamon or reddish-brown color that peels in curly strips like ribbons?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a River Birch - if the bark is white, it might be a different kind of birch"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the tree is growing. Does it have multiple trunks or branches that start low to the ground?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might still be a River Birch - check the leaves"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a triangle or diamond with tiny teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: "You found a River Birch!"
        no_next: "Might be a different tree - check the leaf shape again"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera)"
      differences: "Paper Birch has white bark, not reddish-brown; often has a single trunk rather than multiple stems; less heat tolerant"
      identification_tip: "Check the bark color - Paper Birch is white, River Birch is cinnamon-colored"
    
    - species: "White Alder (Alnus rhombifolia)"
      differences: "Has smooth gray bark that doesn't peel; produces distinctive woody cone-like fruits; leaves have simple serrations"
      identification_tip: "Touch the bark - Alder bark doesn't peel off in paper-like strips"
    
    - species: "Paperbark Maple (Acer griseum)"
      differences: "Has similar exfoliating cinnamon-colored bark but has opposite leaf arrangement and compound leaves with three leaflets"
      identification_tip: "Check how leaves grow - Paperbark Maple leaves grow in pairs opposite each other"
    
    - species: "Red Alder (Alnus rubra)"
      differences: "Has smooth grayish bark that may be mottled but doesn't peel in papery strips; produces cone-like fruits rather than catkins"
      identification_tip: "Look for cone-like fruits on alders versus catkins on birches"

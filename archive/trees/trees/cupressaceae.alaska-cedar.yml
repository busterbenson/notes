  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Drooping branch tips that look sad or sleepy"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a Christmas tree that's taking a nap with its branches hanging down like droopy arms"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel like tiny overlapping fish scales or dragon skin"
    smell_tip: "Crush a small leaf to smell a spicy scent, like a Christmas tree but stronger and with a hint of ginger"
    fun_fact: "Alaska-cedar's wood is so strong that fallen trees can stay solid for hundreds of years! Trees that fell over before your grandparents were born can still be found in forests today."
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1

        no_next: "Not an Alaska-cedar - try looking for other trees with branches that stick straight out"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaves. Are they tiny flat pieces that overlap like fish scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not an Alaska-cedar - check if it has needle-like leaves instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Carefully crush a small leaf and smell. Does it have a spicy smell?"
        yes_next: "You found an Alaska-cedar!"
        no_next: "Might be another type of cedar - check if the branches point up instead of down"

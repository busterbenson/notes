  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small to medium-sized deciduous tree found in wetland areas that resembles elms but with smaller, more asymmetrical leaves and distinctive warty fruits. Has shaggy, peeling bark on mature trees and grows primarily in swamps, floodplains, and along stream banks where it can tolerate periodic flooding."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small to medium deciduous tree with elm-like leaves; grows in wet areas and swamps; has shaggy, peeling bark on mature specimens"
    secondary_markers: "Leaves are asymmetrical at base, smaller than American elm (2-3 inches long); small nutlets covered in warty projections; often multi-trunked growth form"
    seasonal_markers: "Flowers appear before leaves in early spring; fruits mature by late spring; yellow fall color; distinctive branch structure visible in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike true elms, has warty fruits instead of flat, winged samaras; smaller leaves than American elm; rougher texture to bark than hackberry"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A medium-sized tree that loves to grow with its feet wet - you'll find it in swamps and along streams with its slightly rough, peeling bark"
    memorable_comparison: "The leaves look like mini versions of American elm leaves, and the little fruits are bumpy like tiny warts instead of flat like elm seeds"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark - on older trees it peels and flakes off in thin strips"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Water-elm is perfectly happy having wet feet! It can survive in swamps where the ground is underwater for weeks or months at a time. Its wood is so rot-resistant that it was sometimes used for underwater parts of buildings and structures."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where the tree is growing. Is it in a wet area, like near a stream or in a swamp?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Water-elm - they almost always grow in wet places"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the tree size. Is it medium-sized (about 30-40 feet tall) with a somewhat rounded crown?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a young Water-elm or another water-loving tree - check more features"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they alternate (not opposite), simple (not compound), with toothed edges and an asymmetrical base?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Water-elm - check other water-loving trees like willows or river birch"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check the bark. Is it grayish-brown and somewhat flaky or shaggy on older parts of the tree?"
        yes_next: 5
        no_next: "Might not be a Water-elm - check the fruits if present"
      - step: 5
        instruction: "If it's spring, look for small fruits with bumpy warts (not flat, winged seeds like elms)"
        yes_next: "You found a Water-elm!"
        no_next: "Look for other clues like the overall shape and habitat - it might be a Water-elm or a related species"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Small, inconspicuous reddish-brown flowers appear before leaves; leaves emerge light green; small warty fruits develop by late spring"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers February to April; fruits mature May to June"
      identification_tips: "Look for the small warty fruits that appear in clusters - they're distinctive and unlike true elm seeds"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for tiny reddish flowers before the leaves come out, then small bumpy fruits that look like little warty balls"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full canopy of medium green leaves; fruits may persist early in season"
      reproductive_activity: "Fruiting complete; seeds may germinate if conditions are right"
      identification_tips: "Identified by leaf shape and arrangement; look for the asymmetrical leaf base typical of the elm family"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when Water-elm has all its leaves out, making a nice shady spot over the water"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow before falling; branch structure starts to become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds forming for next spring"
      identification_tips: "Look for yellow fall color and the distinctive branching pattern becoming visible as leaves drop"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow like little golden coins before dropping to the ground or water"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal growth form; grayish-brown bark more visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; flower buds present"
      identification_tips: "Identified by bark texture, overall form, and habitat; flaky bark and wetland habitat are key clues"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter when the tree is bare, you can recognize Water-elm by its flaky bark and because it's standing in or very near water"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "American Elm (Ulmus americana)"
      differences: "American Elm grows larger (60-100 feet tall); has winged seeds (samaras), not warty fruits; more uniform vase-shaped crown; bark develops deep furrows rather than becoming shaggy"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has flat, winged seeds instead of warty fruits, and is much taller with a vase-like shape, it's likely an American Elm, not Water-elm"
    
    - species: "Winged Elm (Ulmus alata)"
      differences: "Winged Elm has corky, wing-like growths on twigs (Water-elm lacks these); produces typical elm samaras (winged seeds); tolerates drier conditions; leaves are slightly smaller"
      identification_tip: "Look for the distinctive corky 'wings' on branches of Winged Elm - Water-elm lacks these completely"
    
    - species: "Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis)"
      differences: "Hackberry has distinctive warty bark but smoother overall texture; produces small, berry-like fruits (drupes), not warty nutlets; leaves more elongated with less prominent teeth; more drought-tolerant"
      identification_tip: "If the tree has berry-like fruits instead of warty nutlets, and has distinctive warty/bumpy bark rather than shaggy/flaky bark, it's likely a Hackberry"
    
    - species: "Sugarberry (Celtis laevigata)"
      differences: "Sugarberry has smoother bark; produces berry-like fruits; leaves are more narrow with finer teeth or nearly smooth margins; often grows in similar wet habitats but tolerates drier conditions"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves have fewer, finer teeth and the tree produces berry-like fruits, it's likely a Sugarberry, not Water-elm"

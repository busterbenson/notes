  family: "Pinaceae"
  
  # Basic summary information
  summary: "The Sugar Pine is the tallest type of pine tree and makes the longest cones of any evergreen treeâ€”up to 20 inches long (longer than your forearm). It's known for being huge, with a straight trunk and graceful branches. It's a famous tree of the Sierra Nevada mountain forests."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Super long cones (10-20 inches, like a banana or longer) hanging from branch tips; needles in bundles of five"
    secondary_markers: "Huge older trees with straight trunks; branches that stick out straight then droop at the tips"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green all year; giant cones ripen in late summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Western White Pine, has much longer cones; unlike Ponderosa Pine, has needles in bundles of five, not three"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super long cones - the longest of any pine tree!"
    memorable_comparison: "The giant cones can be longer than your forearm and look like banana-shaped ornaments hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "Count the needles in each bundle - if you find five needles growing together like a little star, it might be a Sugar Pine"
    smell_tip: "The sticky sap smells sweet like maple syrup or cotton candy (but don't touch or taste it - it's super sticky and might cause itchy skin!)"
    fun_fact: "People who lived here long ago called it the 'sugar tree' because the dried sap tastes sweet! John Muir, a famous nature explorer, called it the 'king of the pines' and would eat small bits of the crystallized sap like candy during his mountain adventures."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look for really long cones (as long as your arm from elbow to fingertips) hanging from branches or on the ground"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Sugar Pine - look for other pine trees with shorter cones"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Grab a needle bundle and count - are there exactly 5 needles in each bunch?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Sugar Pine - if there are 2 or 3 needles in each bunch, it's a different pine tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is the tree very tall with a straight trunk and branches that stick out sideways with droopy tips?"
        yes_next: "You found a Sugar Pine!"
        no_next: "Might be Western White Pine, which has shorter cones (about as long as your hand)"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth emerges, lighter green than older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Small yellow pollen bumps release yellow dust; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for bright green new needle growth at branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches grow new baby needles that are brighter green"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New needles grow to full size and darken; young cones become visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones growing but still green and closed"
      identification_tips: "Look for green developing cones hanging from branch tips"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the giant cones start growing - they're still green and not as big as they'll get"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Some older needles on the inside turn yellow and drop; cones turn brown"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones turn brown but usually stay closed until next year"
      identification_tips: "Look for brown mature cones; some needle drop but tree stays mostly green"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the giant cones turn brown and get ready to drop their seeds"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree stays green; may lose some older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Resting; mature cones may stay on the tree through winter"
      identification_tips: "Massive, straight trunk and spreading branches stand out in winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Sugar Pines stay green and you can still see their giant cones hanging like Christmas decorations"

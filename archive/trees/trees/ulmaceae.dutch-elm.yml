  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A large deciduous tree with a classic vase-shaped crown and arching branches that spread widely. It has oval to elliptical leaves with double-toothed edges and uneven bases, and bark that develops distinctive diamond-pattern fissures with age."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Classic vase-shaped form with arching branches; leaves with uneven bases and double-toothed edges"
    secondary_markers: "Gray to grayish-brown bark with diamond-pattern fissures; winged seeds (samaras) that form in spring"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves with uneven bases (one side attaches lower than the other) and double-toothed edges"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a giant fountain or vase with branches that sweep up and then arch outward"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaves - they're slightly rough, like fine sandpaper"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell when crushed"
    fun_fact: "Dutch Elm is a hybrid tree (a mix of two different kinds of elms) that was very popular for planting along streets because it made beautiful green tunnels when the branches met overhead. Sadly, many have been lost to a disease carried by tiny beetles, but people are working hard to breed new Dutch Elms that can resist the disease!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the overall tree shape. Does it have a vase-like shape with branches that go up and then arch outward?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the shape is different, it might not be a Dutch Elm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they oval-shaped with uneven bases (one side of the leaf attaches lower than the other)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the leaf bases are even, it's probably not an elm"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look closely at the leaf edges. Do they have double teeth (big teeth with smaller teeth on them)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the edges have simple teeth or no teeth, it's probably not a Dutch Elm"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "If it's a mature tree, does it have grayish-brown bark with diamond-shaped cracks?"
        yes_next: "You found a Dutch Elm!"
        no_next: "It might be a young Dutch Elm or a different elm species"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, notice how much cool shade the tree makes with its big leafy branches that spread out like an umbrella"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to brownish before falling"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Leaf color change; leaf shape and double-toothed edges still visible"

    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches reveal the vase-shaped silhouette and branching pattern"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, flower buds start developing late in winter"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive vase-shaped form most visible in winter; look for diamond-patterned bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, you can see the tree's beautiful shape that looks like a fountain or fireworks frozen in place"

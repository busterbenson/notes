  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small desert tree with a striking bright green trunk and branches that perform photosynthesis. It has tiny, delicate leaflets that drop during drought periods, and produces masses of bright yellow flowers in spring. Named 'Palo Verde' meaning 'green stick' in Spanish, this tree is highly adapted to desert conditions with thorny branches and drought-deciduous leaves."
  
  # Identification priority
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Bright green trunk and branches; tiny compound leaves; thorny branches; masses of yellow flowers in spring"
    secondary_markers: "Feathery appearance; thin, upright growth habit; peeling thin bark; often leafless during dry periods"
    seasonal_markers: "Spectacular yellow flower display in spring; may drop leaves in summer drought or winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Green bark distinguishes from most other small trees; smaller and more delicate leaflets than mesquite; thorny branches unlike desert willow"

  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with open-ended, creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth green trunk and branches with sharp thorns and tiny feathery leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "The green trunk looks like it's been painted with bright green paint, and in spring it's covered with so many yellow flowers it looks like a yellow explosion!"
    touch_tip: "Be very careful of the sharp thorns! Look but don't touch the branches. The leaves are tiny and feathery."
    smell_tip: "The flowers have a light sweet smell when blooming heavily in spring"
    fun_fact: "Palo Verde trees don't need leaves to make their food! Their green trunks and branches can do photosynthesis, which is why they can drop their leaves when it's too hot and dry and still survive. They're like the desert's super-survivors!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the trunk and branches. Are they bright green, not brown or gray like most trees?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Palo Verde - try looking at trees with different colored bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check for thorns along the branches (but don't touch!). Are there sharp thorns sticking out?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Palo Verde - try looking at other desert trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the leaves (if present). Are they made up of many tiny leaflets giving a feathery appearance?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Palo Verde - check other thorny desert trees"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In spring, does it have lots of bright yellow flowers? In summer or fall, does it have bean-like seed pods?"
        yes_next: "You found a Palo Verde!"
        no_next: "If it's not flowering season, the bright green trunk and thorns are still good clues that it's a Palo Verde"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Desert Ironwood (Olneya tesota)"
      differences: "Ironwood has gray-green bark, not bright green; denser foliage; bluish-pink flowers; much harder wood"
      identification_tip: "If the bark is gray-green instead of bright green, and the flowers are purplish instead of yellow, it's probably Ironwood"
    - species: "Mesquite (Prosopis species)"
      differences: "Mesquite has brown bark, not green; larger leaflets; longer, straighter seed pods; often more spreading habit"
      identification_tip: "If it has brown bark instead of green, with larger leaflets, it's likely a mesquite"
    - species: "Jerusalem Thorn (Parkinsonia aculeata)"
      differences: "This is actually a species of Palo Verde with longer leaves and more drooping branches; technically a Palo Verde but sometimes distinguished"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves have longer straps with tiny leaflets along them, it's specifically the Jerusalem Thorn type of Palo Verde"
      
  seasonal_timeline:

      visual_changes: "Dramatic bloom of bright yellow flowers; new leaf growth"
      reproductive_activity: "Mass flowering, usually March-May"
      identification_tips: "Yellow flower display is unmistakable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tree puts on a yellow flower show so bright it looks like a yellow explosion!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "May drop leaves during hot, dry periods; seed pods develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed pods mature; may have second smaller bloom after summer rains"
      identification_tips: "Green trunk and branches; seed pods; possibly leafless"
      kid_friendly_tip: "During hot summer days, the tree might drop its tiny leaves but stays alive because its green trunk and branches can make food from sunlight"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "May regrow leaves if moisture is available; seed pods dry and may drop"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed dispersal from dried pods"
      identification_tips: "Green branches; dry seed pods; may be leafless or with some foliage"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for dried bean-like pods that rattle in the wind, with seeds inside that might grow into new trees"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "May be leafless or have reduced foliage"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no flowering"
      identification_tips: "Green trunk and branches; thorns; typically few or no leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter when the tree might look bare, you can tell it's a Palo Verde because the trunk and branches stay bright green"

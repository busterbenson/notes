  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall evergreen tree with smooth, peeling bark that reveals multiple colors and strongly aromatic leaves that smell like menthol or cough drops. It has distinctive blue-gray juvenile leaves that are different from the sickle-shaped adult leaves, and produces white flowers followed by woody seed capsules."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Smooth bark that peels in long strips revealing patches of blue, gray, cream, and tan colors; strong menthol smell from crushed leaves"
    secondary_markers: "Different leaf shapes at different ages - round, waxy blue-gray juvenile leaves vs. long, sickle-shaped adult leaves; large, warty seed capsules with a flat top and conical base"
    seasonal_markers: "White, puffy flowers in winter and spring; seed capsules visible year-round; bark peeling mostly in summer"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Red Gum Eucalyptus, has waxy blue-gray juvenile leaves (not green) and larger seed capsules; unlike Silver Dollar Gum, has more elongated adult leaves and taller growth"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:

    touch_tip: "Feel the smooth parts of the bark, and notice how the adult leaves are waxy and stiff"
    smell_tip: "Gently crush a leaf between your fingers and smell - it's like cough drops or chest rub!"
    fun_fact: "This tree can grow super fast - up to 10 feet in just one year! That's like growing as tall as your classroom ceiling every year."
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it peeling off in strips showing different colors underneath?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Might not be a Eucalyptus - check other trees with different bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully pick one leaf (don't take too many) and gently crush it between your fingers. Does it smell strongly like cough drops or medicine?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it doesn't have a strong medicine smell, check other trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for seed capsules on the tree or ground. Are they round and woody with a flat top, about the size of a marble?"
        yes_next: "You found a Blue Gum Eucalyptus!"
        no_next: "If the seed pods look different, it might be another type of Eucalyptus or a different tree"

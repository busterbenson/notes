    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it bright white and peeling off in thin paper-like strips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Resin Birch - might be another type of tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully touch a small twig or bud. Does it feel sticky like it has sap on it?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be a Paper Birch instead of a Resin Birch - they look very similar"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Is it shaped like a pointed oval with tiny double teeth along the edges?"
        yes_next: "You found a Resin Birch!"
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch - check the leaf shape again"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season

      identification_tips: "The resinous, sticky buds and twigs become more noticeable"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the white bark looks bright against the green leaves"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn bright golden yellow before dropping"
      reproductive_activity: "Winged seeds are released from mature female catkins and blown by wind"
      identification_tips: "Golden fall color and seed release help with identification"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera)"
      differences: "Very similar but lacks the distinctively sticky buds and twigs; more commonly planted in California"
      identification_tip: "Touch the buds - Paper Birch buds aren't as sticky as Resin Birch buds"
    
    - species: "European White Birch (Betula pendula)"
      differences: "Has more drooping branches, less peeling bark, and distinctive black diamond-shaped marks on the trunk"
      identification_tip: "Look for black diamond shapes on the trunk - these are present on European Birch but not on Resin Birch"
    
    - species: "River Birch (Betula nigra)"
      differences: "Has cinnamon to reddish-brown peeling bark instead of white bark"
      identification_tip: "Check the bark color - River Birch bark is reddish-brown, not white"
    
    - species: "Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides)"
      differences: "Has smooth white-green bark that doesn't peel and round leaves that quiver in the breeze"
      identification_tip: "Try to peel a small bit of bark - Aspen bark doesn't peel in paper-like strips"

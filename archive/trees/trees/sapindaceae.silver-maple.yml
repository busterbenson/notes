  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A fast-growing, large deciduous tree with deeply cut 5-lobed leaves that flash silvery-white undersides when the wind blows. Leaves have long stems that make them 'dance' in light breezes. Silver Maple has shaggy, flaking bark on mature trees and produces the largest winged seeds of any native maple."
  
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Deeply cut 5-lobed leaves with silvery-white undersides; very long leaf stems; leaves appear to 'dance' or 'twinkle' in even light wind"
    secondary_markers: "Fast-growing, large tree; opposite branching pattern; shaggy, flaking bark on older trees; large paired winged seeds that drop in spring"
    seasonal_markers: "Early flowering in spring before leaves; yellow to pale brown fall color; distinctive opposite buds and branching pattern visible in winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Red Maple, has more deeply cut leaves with silvery undersides; unlike Norway Maple, lacks milky sap when leaf stems are broken; unlike Sugar Maple, has more deeply cut lobes and typically paler fall color"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Leaves that flash silver underneath when the wind blows"
    memorable_comparison: "Leaves look like a hand with long, skinny fingers that are spread wide apart; when the wind blows, they dance and flash silver like tiny mirrors"
    touch_tip: "Feel the leaf - it's thin and bendy with deep cuts between the points"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they make a nice rustling sound in the breeze"
    fun_fact: "Silver maple has the largest helicopter seeds of any maple tree - they can be up to 2 inches long! That's as big as your thumb!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at how the leaves grow on the twigs. Do they grow directly across from each other (opposite)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Silver Maple - their leaves always grow opposite each other"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaf shape. Does it have 5 deeply cut lobes with big spaces between them, like a hand with skinny fingers spread wide apart?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Probably not a Silver Maple - check other maple trees"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Flip a leaf over. Is the underside silvery-white, like it's covered in sparkles?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Silver Maple - silver undersides are a key feature"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Are the leaf stems (petioles) very long, making the leaves dance in even light breezes?"
        yes_next: "You found a Silver Maple!"
        no_next: "Probably not a Silver Maple - they have extra-long leaf stems"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Red Maple (Acer rubrum)"
      differences: "Red Maple has less deeply cut leaf lobes; green rather than silvery undersides; shorter leaf stems; often has red leaf stems; typically shows bright red fall color"
      identification_tip: "Silver Maple leaves have deeper cuts between lobes and flash silver underneath; they also 'dance' more in the breeze due to longer stems"
    - species: "Norway Maple (Acer platanoides)"
      differences: "Norway Maple has broader leaves with much less deeply cut lobes; produces milky sap when leaf stem is broken; has yellow fall color; seeds spread at 180-degree angle"
      identification_tip: "Break a leaf stem - Norway Maple leaks white sap, Silver Maple doesn't; Norway Maple leaves are also much broader with shallow cuts between lobes"
    - species: "Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum)"
      differences: "Sugar Maple leaves have rounded notches between lobes (not deep, pointed cuts); lack silvery undersides; typically show vibrant orange-red fall colors"
      identification_tip: "Silver Maple leaves have much deeper cuts between lobes, creating a more star-like appearance with skinny 'fingers'"
    - species: "Freeman Maple (Acer Ã— freemanii)"
      differences: "Freeman Maple (hybrid between Red and Silver Maple) has intermediate characteristics; leaf lobes not as deeply cut as Silver Maple; better fall color"
      identification_tip: "Freeman Maple leaves will show some silvery undersides and some deeper cuts, but not as extreme as pure Silver Maple"

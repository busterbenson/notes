  summary: "Siberian Elm is a medium to large deciduous tree with a rounded, somewhat irregular crown. Known for its exceptional tolerance to drought, poor soils, and urban pollution, it was widely planted throughout the United States, including California, for shade and windbreaks. Distinguished by its small, single-toothed leaves and prolific seed production, this fast-growing tree has become invasive in many regions. While valued historically for its hardiness in harsh conditions, it's now often discouraged in new plantings due to its aggressive spread, brittle wood, and pest susceptibility."

  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Small (1-3 inch) elliptical leaves with single-toothed edges; slightly asymmetrical leaf bases"
    secondary_markers: "Abundant round, flat winged seeds in spring; gray-brown bark with shallow furrows"
    seasonal_markers: "One of the earliest trees to flower and produce seeds in spring; yellow fall color"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike American Elm, has a rounded (not vase-shaped) crown and single-toothed (not double-toothed) leaf edges; unlike Chinese Elm, produces seeds in spring not fall"

  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Small leaves with tiny single teeth along the edges"
    memorable_comparison: "The seeds look like little green frisbees with a bump in the middle"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel a bit rough like fine sandpaper, but not as scratchy as other elm trees"
    smell_tip: "The leaves don't have a strong smell, but they might have a slight fresh, green scent if crushed"
    fun_fact: "This tree grows super fast - sometimes more than 3 feet in a single year! That's about as tall as you might grow in 3 whole years!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check the leaves. Are they small (about as long as your thumb) with tiny teeth all around the edges?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Siberian Elm. If the leaves are larger or have double teeth, check other elm species."
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at how the leaves grow on the branch. Do they alternate sides along the branch (not grow in pairs)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Siberian Elm. If leaves grow in pairs opposite each other, it's a different tree family."
      - step: 3
        instruction: "If it's spring, do you see lots of flat, round, papery seeds that look like little green frisbees?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "It might still be Siberian Elm, but in a different season. Check the other features."
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look at the overall tree shape. Does it have a rounded crown rather than a vase shape with drooping branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a Siberian Elm!"
        no_next: "If the tree has a vase shape with arching branches, it might be American Elm instead."

  look_alikes:
    - species: "American Elm (Ulmus americana)"

      differences: "Has smaller, glossier leaves; distinctive mottled, exfoliating bark showing multiple colors; flowers and fruits in fall rather than spring"
      identification_tip: "If the bark flakes off in patches showing orange, green, and gray colors, it's Chinese Elm"
    
    - species: "Dutch Elm (Ulmus Ã— hollandica)"
      differences: "Has a more pronounced vase shape; leaves with double-toothed edges; more substantial bark furrows; generally grows larger at maturity"

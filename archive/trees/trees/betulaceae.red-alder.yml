  # Kid-friendly identification - expanded with creative descriptions
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Reddish inner bark that appears like magic when you gently scratch the outer bark"
    memorable_comparison: "Like a tree wearing a gray coat over an orange shirt - scratch the gray and you see the orange underneath!"
    touch_tip: "The leaves feel slightly bumpy because of the veins, and the edges curl under a bit like tiny taco shells"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently to smell a sweet, fresh scent"
    fun_fact: "Red Alder is a forest superhero! It can grow in poor soil and actually makes the soil better for other plants by adding nitrogen - like sprinkling natural plant food around itself!"
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check where you are. Are you in a wet area near the coast in Northern California?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If you're in dry areas or high mountains, it's probably not a Red Alder"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it smooth and gray, sometimes with white patches?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the bark is rough, dark, or peeling, it might be a different tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Gently scratch a small spot on the bark with your fingernail. Does it show reddish-orange underneath?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the inner bark isn't reddish, it might be White Alder or another tree"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Check for small woody cone-like fruits about the size of a grape. Do you see any on the tree or ground?"
        yes_next: "You found a Red Alder!"
        no_next: "If it's early spring, look for hanging catkins instead. If those aren't visible, check the leaves - they should be oval with toothed edges that curl under slightly."

  look_alikes:
    - species: "White Alder (Alnus rhombifolia)"
      differences: "White Alder lacks the reddish inner bark; has flatter leaf edges and grows at higher elevations inland"
      identification_tip: "Scratch the bark - if no reddish color appears, it's probably White Alder"
    - species: "Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera)"
      differences: "Paper Birch has distinctive white peeling bark and lacks the woody cone-like fruits"
      identification_tip: "Birches have papery, peeling bark and produce small winged seeds, not woody cones"
    - species: "Arizona Alder (Alnus oblongifolia)"
      differences: "Arizona Alder grows in mountain streams of Southern California and Arizona, not coastal forests"
      identification_tip: "Check location - Red Alder is mainly coastal, while Arizona Alder is in mountains far from the coast"
      
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Brown catkins dangle before leaves appear; new leaves emerge light green with sticky texture"

      identification_tips: "Hanging catkins are very noticeable in early spring before leaves fully emerge"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for dangling brown 'caterpillars' (catkins) hanging from branches in early spring"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Full crown of green oval leaves; cone-like fruits begin to develop"
      reproductive_activity: "Small cone-like fruits grow and develop throughout summer"
      identification_tips: "Smooth gray bark, reddish inner bark, and distinct leaf shape are good summer identifiers"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, check for the orange 'surprise' under the gray bark by gently scratching it"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow to rusty brown before dropping"
      reproductive_activity: "Woody cone-like fruits mature to brown"
      identification_tips: "Small brown woody cone-like fruits become more visible as leaves fall"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for small woody 'pinecones' that don't belong on a tree with regular leaves!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Bare branches with persistent small cone-like fruits; new catkins begin forming"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; cone-like fruits from previous year remain on branches"
      identification_tips: "Smooth gray bark, reddish inner bark, and persistent woody cones help identify in winter"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even with no leaves, you can still find it by scratching the bark to reveal the reddish 'magic' underneath"

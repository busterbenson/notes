  # Basic summary
  summary: "A distinctive pine tree with sparse, gray-green foliage and massive, heavy cones. Its very long needles grow in bundles of three, and it has a unique Y-shaped growth pattern that makes it easy to recognize from a distance. Native people valued its large, nutritious seeds as an important food source."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Y-shaped growth form with widely spaced branches; large, heavy cones (6-10 inches); very long needles (8-12 inches) in bundles of three"
    secondary_markers: "Sparse, gray-green foliage; thick, scaly gray-brown bark; grows in dry foothill areas"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green year-round; large cones mature in fall and can stay on the tree for years"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Ponderosa Pine, has Y-shaped growth form and much sparser foliage; unlike Coulter Pine, grows in lower elevations and has less massive cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Y-shaped trunk and big, heavy pine cones"
    memorable_comparison: "This tree looks like it's holding up its arms in a big Y shape, and its cones are so heavy they could bonk you on the head if they fell!"
    touch_tip: "Count the needles in each bundle - if you find exactly three very long needles growing together, it might be a Gray Pine"
    smell_tip: "The needles smell like strong pine when you gently crush them (don't break them!)"
    fun_fact: "Native Americans called this the 'digger pine' because they used special digging tools to harvest the fallen cones for their nutritious seeds. The cones are so heavy they've been known to dent car hoods when they fall in parking lots!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's shape. Does it have a Y-shaped trunk or branches that spread out widely?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Gray Pine - look for trees with a more regular shape"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Grab a needle bundle and count - are there exactly 3 needles in each bunch?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Gray Pine - if there are 2 or 5 needles in each bunch, it's a different pine tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Are the needles very long (8-12 inches, longer than your hand) and gray-green in color?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Might be a Ponderosa Pine, which has shorter, more yellow-green needles"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Look for big, heavy cones that are 6-10 inches long. Can you find any on the tree or on the ground nearby?"
        yes_next: "You found a Gray Pine!"
        no_next: "It might still be a Gray Pine if it's not cone season, check for the other features again"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth begins; small male pollen cones release yellow dust"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen is released; tiny female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Yellow pollen may be visible on branches; needles look their brightest"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tree makes tiny yellow pollen bumps that release dust like little smoke bombs!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Needles reach full size; young cones continue growing"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones growing larger"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive gray-green color and Y-shape stand out against other pines"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, the baby cones grow bigger - they're green and hard, like unripe fruit"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Second-year cones turn brown and begin to open"
      reproductive_activity: "Mature cones release seeds"
      identification_tips: "Large brown cones may be visible hanging from branches or on the ground"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is cone season! Look for the huge brown cones falling to the ground - they're as big as a banana!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree stays green; old cones may remain on tree"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Y-shaped form is more visible when other deciduous trees are bare"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Gray Pines stay green, and their big cones might still be hanging on the branches"

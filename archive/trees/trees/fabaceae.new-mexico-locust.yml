  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A small deciduous tree or large shrub with feathery compound leaves, showy pink to purple flower clusters, and thorny branches. It has smooth gray bark when young that becomes furrowed with age and produces flat seed pods."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with small oval leaflets arranged in pairs; bright pink to rose-purple flowers in hanging clusters; thorns in pairs at leaf bases"
    secondary_markers: "Gray bark that starts smooth and becomes more furrowed with age; flat brown seed pods; often grows with multiple stems"
    seasonal_markers: "Showy pink-purple flowers in late spring; yellow fall leaf color; seed pods persist into winter"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Black Locust, has pink-purple (not white) flowers; unlike Bristly Locust, has hard thorns (not soft bristles); smaller overall size than both"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree with pretty pink-purple flowers and rows of small oval leaves along stems, plus sharp thorns at each leaf base"
    memorable_comparison: "The pink-purple flowers look like bunches of small sweet peas hanging from the branches"
    touch_tip: "Carefully feel the smooth gray bark on the trunk, but watch out for the sharp thorns on branches!"
    smell_tip: "In spring, smell the sweet pink flower clusters that hang down like bunches of grapes"
    fun_fact: "This tree's pink flowers are full of sweet nectar that attracts hummingbirds! Native Americans used to make bows from the strong wood because it wouldn't break easily, even when bent a lot."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the size. Is it a small tree (about as tall as a one-story house) or large shrub with multiple trunks?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If it's much taller, it might be a different locust tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have rows of small oval leaflets along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a New Mexico Locust - check trees with simple leaves instead of compound ones"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check for flower color. Are the flowers pink to purple (not white)?"
        yes_next: "You found a New Mexico Locust! Look for the paired thorns at leaf bases to be sure."
        no_next: "If flowers are white, it might be a Black Locust instead"

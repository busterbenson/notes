  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A slow-growing understory evergreen tree with flat, dark green needles arranged in two rows, distinctive reddish-purple, flaky bark, and unique red berry-like structures containing seeds instead of cones. Its wood is extremely strong, and it contains compounds used in cancer treatment."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Flat needles arranged in two rows along twigs; red berry-like structures (arils) containing single seeds; distinctive reddish-purple, flaky or scaly bark"
    secondary_markers: "Small size, often growing as an understory tree; scattered, irregular branching pattern; extremely hard, dense wood"
    seasonal_markers: "Berry-like red arils present in late summer through fall; new growth in spring slightly lighter green"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike hemlocks, has no cones and has bright red berry-like seed coverings; unlike redwood or California Torreya, has softer, less pointed needles arranged more distinctly in two rows"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A small tree with dark green flat needles in two rows and bright red berry-like fruits (but not real berries)"
    memorable_comparison: "The branches look like flat green ferns, and in fall they're decorated with bright red 'cups' holding single seeds that look like tiny olives"
    touch_tip: "The needles are soft and flat - not sharp or pokey at all - and feel like a flattened fern branch"
    smell_tip: "The needles don't have a strong smell, but they feel soft when you touch them gently"
    fun_fact: "Pacific Yew is like a superhero tree - it contains a special substance called taxol that doctors use to make medicine that fights cancer! Scientists discovered this in the 1960s, and it's helped save many lives. The tree grows super slowly but can live for hundreds of years, and its wood is so strong that Native Americans used it to make bows, paddles, and tools."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Are they flat, soft (not pokey), and arranged in two rows along the twig like a flat fern frond?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Pacific Yew - if the needles are sharp and pokey, check spruce; if they're in bundles, check pines"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the bark. Is it thin and flaky with a reddish-purple color underneath?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "It might be hemlock or another conifer - Pacific Yew has very distinctive thin, flaky, reddish-purple bark"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "In late summer or fall, do you see bright red berry-like cups with seeds, rather than cones? (Or is it a small understory tree with the right needles and bark?)"
        yes_next: "You found a Pacific Yew!"
        no_next: "If it has small cones instead of red berry-like structures, it might be hemlock or another conifer"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New needle growth appears as slightly lighter green at branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen is released from small, inconspicuous male structures"
      identification_tips: "New growth slightly brighter green; look for reddish-purple flaky bark"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for light green new growth at the tips of branches, like tiny green paintbrushes"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older foliage; seed structures begin developing"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds develop inside green arils that will later turn red"
      identification_tips: "Green developing arils may be visible on female trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you might see small green berry-like structures forming on female trees"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Seed arils mature and turn bright red; no needle color change"
      reproductive_activity: "Arils fully mature, attracting birds that eat them and disperse seeds"
      identification_tips: "Bright red arils are very distinctive and a key identification feature"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, look for bright red 'cups' holding dark seeds - they look like little red candies but are NOT for eating!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Remains evergreen; most arils have been eaten by birds or fallen"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no significant reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive bark and needle arrangement remain visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter, it keeps its green needles when other trees lose their leaves; look for the special reddish-purple flaky bark"

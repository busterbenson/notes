  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall evergreen tree native to Southern California mountains, distinguished by its massive cones that are much larger than other Douglas-firs. It has flat, soft needles that radiate around the twig and thick, fire-resistant bark that helps it survive in fire-prone regions."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Exceptionally large cones (4-8 inches long) with three-pointed 'mouse tail' bracts; flat needles radiating around twig"
    secondary_markers: "Very thick, deeply furrowed bark; grows in Southern California mountains"
    seasonal_markers: "Cones mature in late summer and fall; needles remain year-round"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Douglas-fir, has much larger cones and is found only in Southern California; unlike pines, needles grow individually, not in bundles"

    fun_fact: "Bigcone Douglas-fir trees can survive forest fires because they grow super thick bark - like wearing a fire-proof jacket!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, check if you're in Southern California mountains. Bigcone Douglas-fir only grows there!"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Bigcone Douglas-fir - they only grow in Southern California"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look for really big cones on the ground (about as long as your hand). Do they have three-pointed 'mouse tail' bracts sticking out between the scales?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Bigcone Douglas-fir - check regular Douglas-fir or another conifer"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at the tree trunk. Is the bark very thick with deep grooves like a maze?"
        yes_next: "You found a Bigcone Douglas-fir!"
        no_next: "If the bark is thinner or the tree is young, check if you can find more cones to confirm"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears at branch tips in a lighter green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Pollen cones release yellow pollen; female cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Contrast between new growth and older needles; pollen release may be visible"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, the tips of branches get bright new baby needles that are lighter green"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth matures to match older needles"
      reproductive_activity: "Young cones continue growing larger"
      identification_tips: "Developing cones become more noticeable as they grow"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the baby cones grow bigger - they're green at first"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No color change as it remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones mature and begin to open, eventually falling from the tree"
      identification_tips: "Look for mature brown cones on the tree and ground"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Fall is the best time to find the fully grown, brown cones that have fallen to the ground"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Evergreen foliage remains; may collect snow in higher elevations"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant, no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive form and evergreen nature visible against winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter when other trees lose their leaves, this tree stays green"

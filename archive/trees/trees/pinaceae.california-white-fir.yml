  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall evergreen tree with long, curved, blue-green needles that sweep upward like smiles on the branches. The bark is smooth and gray on young trees, becoming deeply furrowed as it matures."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Blue-green curved needles that point upward; soft needles with rounded (not sharp) tips"
    secondary_markers: "Upright cylindrical cones on upper branches; smooth gray bark on young trees that becomes deeply furrowed with age"
    seasonal_markers: "Bright blue-green new growth in spring; cones mature and disintegrate on the tree in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Noble Fir, has longer needles (2-3 inches); unlike Douglas-fir, has upright cones rather than hanging cones with 'mouse tail' bracts"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Do they curve upward like smiles and have a blue-green color?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a White Fir - try Douglas-fir or another conifer"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Gently feel a needle. Is it flat and soft, not pokey on the end?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a White Fir - check if it might be a spruce with pokey needles"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look up high in the tree during summer or fall. Can you see cones standing straight up like candles on the branches?"
        yes_next: "You found a White Fir!"
        no_next: "Might still be a White Fir, but check the bark - is it gray with deep grooves on older trees?"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Bright blue-green new growth appears at branch tips"

      differences: "Noble Fir has shorter, stiffer needles that curve upward more dramatically and often has a bluish bloom"
      identification_tip: "White Fir needles are longer (2-3 inches) and more gently curved than Noble Fir needles"

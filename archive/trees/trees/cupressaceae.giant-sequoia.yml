  # Basic summary information
  summary: "An incredibly massive evergreen tree with a huge trunk that can grow wider than a car is long and as tall as a 25-story building. Has distinctive reddish-brown, spongy bark and small, scale-like, spiky leaves that grow all around the twigs. Makes woody cones about the size of a chicken egg."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Massive trunk with reddish-brown, fibrous bark; scale-like, spiky leaves growing all around branches; columnar shape with rounded top on mature trees"
    secondary_markers: "Egg-sized woody cones; spongy, fire-resistant bark up to 2 feet thick; tiny scale-like leaves that are prickly to touch"
    seasonal_markers: "Stays green all year; small cones can stay on tree for many years; releases seeds after fire or when cones dry out"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Coast Redwood, has spiky (not flat) leaves and much fatter trunk compared to height; unlike Incense-cedar, has rounded not flattened sprays of foliage and larger, rounder cones"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Super fat tree trunk with red, spongy bark and tiny spiky leaves"
    memorable_comparison: "The trunk is so wide that 10-15 kids holding hands might be needed to reach around it! The bark is squishy like a giant sponge."
    touch_tip: "Gently touch the bark - it feels soft and spongy, and if you're careful you can push your finger into it a little bit"
    smell_tip: "Crush a leaf gently for a mild, sweet woodsy scent"
    fun_fact: "Giant Sequoias can live for over 3,000 years! Their bark is so thick (up to 2 feet) that they usually survive forest fires that kill other trees. One tree called 'General Sherman' is the largest tree in the world by volume - it contains enough wood to build 120 houses!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the trunk. Is it extremely wide and covered with reddish-brown, spongy-looking bark?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Giant Sequoia - try another evergreen tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Are they tiny, scale-like, and a bit spiky when you touch them gently?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Giant Sequoia - if the needles are flat and soft, check Coast Redwood"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look for cones on the tree or ground. Are they about the size of a chicken egg (2-3 inches) and woody?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If the cones are tiny (grape-sized), it might be a Coast Redwood instead"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Where are you? Giant Sequoias grow naturally only in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California."
        yes_next: "You found a Giant Sequoia!"
        no_next: "If you're near the coast, it's more likely a Coast Redwood, which looks similar"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New growth appears at branch tips with slightly lighter green color"
      reproductive_activity: "Tiny pollen cones release yellow pollen; new seed cones begin forming"
      identification_tips: "Look for the contrast between light green new growth and older darker foliage"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bright green new growth at the tips of branches - like the tree is growing tiny new fingers!"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "New growth darkens to match the rest of the foliage; tree has full set of leaves"
      reproductive_activity: "Seed cones continue developing, staying green"
      identification_tips: "Dark green color throughout; visible developing cones"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In summer, everything is dark green and the baby cones are growing bigger"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "No significant color change as it remains evergreen"
      reproductive_activity: "Cones begin to mature but usually stay closed"
      identification_tips: "Stays green while other types of trees change color and lose leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "While other trees turn yellow, orange, and red in fall, Giant Sequoias stay green all year long"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Foliage stays dark green; snow may collect on branches"
      reproductive_activity: "Tree rests; cones remain on tree"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive shape stands out in winter landscape"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in snowy winter, Giant Sequoia stays green - sometimes snow makes the branches look like they're decorated for the holidays!"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)"
      differences: "Coast Redwood has flat, soft needles (not spiky scales); much smaller cones (grape-sized); narrower trunk compared to height; grows along the coast, not in mountains"
      identification_tip: "If the leaves are flat and soft like fern fronds, and the cones are small like grapes, it's likely a Coast Redwood"
    
    - species: "Incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens)"
      differences: "Incense-cedar has flattened sprays of scale leaves; distinctive 'duck-bill' shaped cones; strong pencil-like smell; much narrower trunk"
      identification_tip: "If the foliage is in flat sprays like fans and smells strongly like pencil shavings, it's likely an Incense-cedar"
    
    - species: "Giant Redwood/Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides)"
      differences: "Dawn Redwood drops all its needles in fall; has needles growing in pairs directly opposite each other; not native to California"
      identification_tip: "If the tree drops all its needles in fall, it's Dawn Redwood (not Giant Sequoia)"

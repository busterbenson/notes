  # Basic summary (2-3 sentences of most distinctive features)
  summary: "A tall conifer with a narrow, spire-like crown and thin, scaly bark. It has short, square needles that feel sharp and grow all around the twigs, with hanging cones that have thin, flexible scales."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Square needles that can be rolled between fingers; sharp to the touch; needles grow all around the twig"
    secondary_markers: "Thin, scaly, flaky bark; narrow, spire-like shape; cylindrical hanging cones"
    seasonal_markers: "New growth has bright green tips in spring; mature cones hang down in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike firs, has square (not flat) needles and hanging (not upright) cones; unlike pines, needles grow singly, not in bundles"

    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "First, look at the needles. Are they short, pointy, and growing all around the twig like a bottle brush?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not an Engelmann spruce—check if it has needles in bundles (pine) or flat needles in rows (fir)"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Carefully touch a needle (don't grab!). Does it feel sharp and can you roll it between your fingers?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If the needle is flat and doesn't roll, it might be a fir tree instead"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Look at any cones on the tree or ground. Do they hang down from branches and have thin scales?"
        yes_next: "You found an Engelmann spruce!"
        no_next: "If cones stand upright, it's probably a fir tree"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "White Fir (Abies concolor)"
      differences: "White Fir has flat needles that can't be rolled, softer to touch, and upright cones that disintegrate on the tree"
      identification_tip: "If the needles are flat (not square) and soft, and cones stand up like candles, it's a fir, not a spruce"
    
    - species: "Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta)"
      differences: "Lodgepole Pine has needles in bundles of two, much longer needles, and rounder, prickly cones"
      identification_tip: "If needles grow in pairs from the same point, it's definitely a pine, not a spruce"
      
    - species: "Blue Spruce (Picea pungens)"
      differences: "Blue Spruce has much bluer needles, sharper to touch, and grows at lower elevations"
      identification_tip: "If the tree looks very blue-silver and needles are extra sharp, it's likely Blue Spruce"

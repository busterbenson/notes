        instruction: "First, look at the bark. Is it white and peeling in paper-like strips?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Heartleaf Birch - check other trees with different bark"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at a leaf. Does it have a heart-shaped base where it connects to the stem?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Might be another type of birch - check Paper Birch which has more oval leaf bases"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the leaf edges. Do they have small teeth with even smaller teeth in between (double teeth)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "Not a Heartleaf Birch - their leaves have distinctive double-toothed edges"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "Where are you? Heartleaf Birch grows in northeastern North America, especially in mountains."
        yes_next: "You found a Heartleaf Birch!"

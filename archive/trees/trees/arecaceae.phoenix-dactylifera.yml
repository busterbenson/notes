  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A tall palm tree with a single thick trunk and feathery fronds arranged in a crown at the top. Known for producing edible date fruits that hang in large clusters, it has been cultivated for thousands of years and is a common ornamental tree in southern California."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Tall palm with feathery fronds (not fan-shaped); produces dates in hanging clusters; sharp spines at base of fronds"
    secondary_markers: "Single thick trunk with diamond-pattern from old leaf bases; feathery fronds up to 20 feet long"
    seasonal_markers: "Produces dates that ripen from yellow to brown in late summer and fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike fan palms, has feathery (pinnate) fronds rather than fan-shaped; unlike Canary Island Date Palm, typically has a more slender trunk and produces edible dates"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tall palm tree with feathery fronds (not fan-shaped) and clusters of sweet dates that hang down"
    memorable_comparison: "The fronds look like giant green feathers sticking out from the top of a tall pole, and in fall they grow delicious dates like bunches of little brown oval candies hanging down!"
    touch_tip: "Be careful! The base of the fronds has sharp spines that can poke you. The dates are soft and sticky when ripe."
    smell_tip: "Ripe dates have a sweet, honey-like smell. The fronds don't have much scent."
    fun_fact: "Date Palms are one of the oldest fruit trees that humans have grown, for over 6,000 years! In desert countries, people call them the 'tree of life' because they provide food, shade, and materials for building - almost everything people need to survive in the desert!"
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Is it a tall palm tree with long feathery fronds (not fan-shaped)?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "If the fronds are fan-shaped like an open hand, it's a different kind of palm"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Does the tree have a single straight trunk with a rough diamond pattern from old leaf bases?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "If it has multiple trunks or a different bark texture, it might be another palm species"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Do the fronds have sharp spines at their base (be careful, don't touch!)?"
        yes_next: 4
        no_next: "If there are no spines, it's probably a different kind of feather palm"
      - step: 4
        instruction: "In late summer or fall, are there clusters of dates hanging down (they start yellowish and turn brown when ripe)?"
        yes_next: "You found a Date Palm!"
        no_next: "It might be a Date Palm that's not fruiting (maybe it's a male tree or too young), or a similar-looking palm like a Canary Island Date Palm"
  
  # Seasonal changes
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "New fronds emerge from center of crown; large flower clusters appear"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers bloom; pollination occurs (wind or hand-pollinated in cultivation)"
      identification_tips: "Flower clusters are visible; may see old fruit clusters from previous year"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for new bright green fronds growing from the middle, and big flower bunches that will later turn into dates"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Crown fully developed; unripe green or yellow dates begin developing in clusters"
      reproductive_activity: "Dates develop and begin to ripen"
      identification_tips: "Developing date clusters visible on female trees"
      kid_friendly_tip: "By summer, you can see the baby dates growing in big bunches - they're hard and green or yellow"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Dates ripen, changing from yellow to brown; some fronds may brown slightly"
      reproductive_activity: "Dates fully ripen; commercial harvest occurs"
      identification_tips: "Brown, ripe dates hanging in large clusters are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the dates turn brown and get soft and sweet - this is when they're ready to eat!"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Some older fronds may brown and droop but tree remains generally unchanged"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant"
      identification_tips: "Distinctive silhouette; may still have some dried fruit clusters"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Even in winter, Date Palms stay green and tall, though some of the older fronds might turn brown"

  # Basic summary
  summary: "A distinctive broadleaf evergreen tree with smooth, peeling cinnamon-red bark and leathery dark green leaves. It produces clusters of urn-shaped white flowers followed by bright red berries in fall."
  
  # Identification path guides the decision tree
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Smooth, peeling reddish-orange bark; glossy, leathery evergreen leaves"
    secondary_markers: "White bell-shaped flowers in spring; clusters of bright red berries in fall"
    seasonal_markers: "New bark peeling to reveal smooth red-orange surface in summer; red berries visible in fall and winter"

  # Kid-friendly identification section
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "Smooth, peeling red-orange bark that feels cool to touch"
    memorable_comparison: "Looks like a tree that's peeling from a sunburn, showing bright red-orange skin underneath"
    touch_tip: "The bark feels smooth and cool like plastic, while the leaves feel stiff and leathery like fake plant leaves"

    fun_fact: "The bark peels off in curly strips that native peoples sometimes used as emergency bandages to wrap small cuts!"
    
    # Detective steps walk children through identification
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at the tree's bark. Is it peeling to show smooth red or orange patches underneath?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Not a Pacific Madrone - try checking for manzanita which is smaller or another tree"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Check the leaves. Are they thick, shiny and dark green like plastic plant leaves?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Pacific Madrone - might be a different evergreen tree"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Is it a full-sized tree (taller than a house) with either white flowers or red berries depending on the season?"
        yes_next: "You found a Pacific Madrone!"
        no_next: "Might be a manzanita shrub, which is like a mini-version of madrone"
  
  # Seasonal changes - separate entry for each season
  seasonal_timeline:
    - season: "Spring"
      visual_changes: "Clusters of small white bell-shaped flowers appear on branch tips"
      reproductive_activity: "Flowers attract many pollinators including bees and hummingbirds"
      identification_tips: "Look for hanging clusters of small white flowers that look like tiny upside-down bells"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In spring, look for bunches of little white bells hanging from the branches"
    
    - season: "Summer" 
      visual_changes: "Old bark peels away revealing fresh, smooth reddish bark"
      reproductive_activity: "Green berries begin to develop from pollinated flowers"
      identification_tips: "Peeling bark is most visible in summer heat"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Summer is when the tree 'peels its sunburn' showing bright red-orange skin"
    
    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Berries ripen to bright red-orange"
      reproductive_activity: "Ripe berries attract birds that help spread seeds"
      identification_tips: "Bright clusters of red berries stand out against dark green leaves"
      kid_friendly_tip: "Look for bunches of bright red berries that look like tiny Christmas ornaments"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Some berries may remain into winter if not eaten by birds"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; some berries may persist"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.)"
      differences: "Manzanitas are shrubs or small trees, rarely exceeding 20 feet tall; madrones grow to 50-100 feet; manzanitas have smaller leaves"
      identification_tip: "If it's taller than a house with big leaves, it's probably madrone, not manzanita"
    
    - species: "Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)"
      differences: "Toyon has rough bark instead of smooth peeling bark; toyon leaves have serrated edges while madrone has smooth leaf edges"
      identification_tip: "Check the bark - if it's rough and doesn't peel to show red, it's probably toyon"

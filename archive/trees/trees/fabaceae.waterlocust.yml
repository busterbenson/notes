  # Basic summary information
  summary: "A medium-sized deciduous tree with compound leaves, thorny branches, and distinctive flattened seed pods. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in wet areas and floodplains, adapting perfectly to seasonal flooding. Distinguished by its shorter, often solitary thorns and shorter seed pods compared to its close relative, the Honeylocust."
  
  # Identification path
  identification_path:
    primary_markers: "Compound leaves with small oval leaflets; often solitary thorns on branches; grows in wet habitats"
    secondary_markers: "Single or non-branched thorns; short, oval-shaped seed pods; typically found near water"
    seasonal_markers: "Small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spring; seed pods turning reddish-brown in fall"
    similar_species_differentiation: "Unlike Honeylocust (G. triacanthos), has shorter, less branched thorns and shorter seed pods; unlike Black Locust, has smaller, less fragrant flowers and single (not paired) thorns"

  # Kid-friendly identification
  kid_friendly_identification:
    primary_identifier: "A tree with many tiny leaflets on each leaf stem that grows near water and has single thorns on its branches"
    memorable_comparison: "The thorns are like single guardians protecting the tree, and the seed pods look like small, flat ovals - much shorter than the long, twisted pods of its cousin, the Honeylocust"
    touch_tip: "Feel the bark but be careful of the thorns! Notice how the tree is happy growing where its feet get wet."
    smell_tip: "The flowers are small and don't have a strong smell, but they help produce the interesting seed pods"
    fun_fact: "Waterlocust is like a superhero tree that can breathe underwater! It can survive having its roots completely flooded for weeks or even months, making it perfect for swampy areas where other trees would drown."
    
    detective_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: "Look at where the tree is growing. Is it near water, in a floodplain, or in a swampy area?"
        yes_next: 2
        no_next: "Probably not a Waterlocust - they almost always grow where it's wet"
      - step: 2
        instruction: "Look at the leaves. Do they have many small oval leaflets along a central stem (like a feather)?"
        yes_next: 3
        no_next: "Not a Waterlocust - check trees with different leaf patterns"
      - step: 3
        instruction: "Check the branches. Do you see single (not branched or paired) thorns growing from them?"
        yes_next: "You found a Waterlocust! If it's summer or fall, look for small oval seed pods about 1-2 inches long."
        no_next: "If the thorns are large and branched like a deer's antler, it might be a Honeylocust instead. If thorns are paired, it might be a Black Locust."

    - season: "Fall"
      visual_changes: "Leaves turn yellow; seed pods fully brown and mature"
      reproductive_activity: "Seeds mature inside pods; pods may begin to drop"
      identification_tips: "Yellow fall color and reddish-brown seed pods are distinctive"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In fall, the leaves turn yellow like little golden coins, and the seed pods turn reddish-brown"
    
    - season: "Winter"
      visual_changes: "Tree loses all leaves; some seed pods may remain; thorns clearly visible"
      reproductive_activity: "Dormant; no reproductive activity"
      identification_tips: "Thorny twigs; sometimes persistent seed pods; often in flooded areas"
      kid_friendly_tip: "In winter with no leaves, you can easily see the thorns and the tree might be standing in water"

  look_alikes:
    - species: "Honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos)"
      differences: "Honeylocust has larger, often branched thorns and longer, twisted seed pods (10-18 inches); more drought-tolerant and less restricted to wet areas"
      identification_tip: "Waterlocust has shorter seed pods (1-2 inches) and thrives in wet conditions; Honeylocust has longer pods and can grow in drier sites"
    - species: "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia)"
      differences: "Black Locust has paired thorns at leaf bases, not single thorns along branches; has fragrant white flower clusters; and rougher, more deeply furrowed bark"
      identification_tip: "Look for paired vs. single thorns, and Black Locust doesn't specifically prefer wet habitats like Waterlocust does"

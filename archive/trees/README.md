# California Tree Identification Guide for Kids

A comprehensive guide to help children (ages 8-10) identify trees in California through easily observable characteristics.

## Project Overview

This project creates a kid-friendly decision tree system for identifying California trees. The guide focuses on observable characteristics that children can use without specialized botanical knowledge, organizing trees into logical paths based on leaf type, season, habitat, and other visible features.

## Project Structure

### Tree Profiles (`/trees/`)
- 165 standardized YAML files containing comprehensive information on California trees
- Each file follows the format `[family-name].[common-tree-name].yml`
- Profiles include identification features, seasonal changes, kid-friendly tips, and cultural/ecological information

### Decision Trees (`/decision_trees/`)
- **broadleaf-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with flat, broad leaves
- **needle-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with needle-like leaves
- **scale-path.md** - Identification guide for trees with scale-like leaves
- **habitat-path.md** - Habitat-based identification approach
- **seasonal-path.md** - Season-specific identification techniques
- **reproductive-features-path.md** - Identification based on cones, fruits, flowers, and other reproductive features
- **california-tree-guide.md** - The comprehensive guide that combines all paths
- **guide-2025-03-22.md** - Initial draft of the guide with simplified paths
- **guide-2025-03-24.md** - Updated guide with expanded entry points

### Supporting Files
- **features.yml** - Taxonomy of tree identification features with standardized IDs
- **instructions.md** - Guidelines for creating tree profile files
- **tree-tracking.md** - Tracking progress of tree profile creation

## Features

1. **Kid-Friendly Language**: All descriptions use concrete, engaging language appropriate for 8-10 year olds
2. **Observable Characteristics**: Focus on features that can be directly observed without specialized equipment
3. **Multi-Entry Points**: Different ways to approach identification based on what's visible
4. **Seasonal Adaptations**: How to identify trees in different seasons
5. **Confirmation Checkpoints**: Verification steps to ensure correct identification
6. **Visual Descriptors**: Memorable comparisons and simple analogies
7. **Safety Notes**: Clear guidance on safe interaction with trees

## Usage

The main entry point is `decision_trees/california-tree-guide.md`, which provides multiple ways to start the identification process:

1. By leaf type (broadleaf, needle, scale)
2. By observation distance (close-up vs. far away)
3. By season (spring, summer, fall, winter)
4. By habitat (coastal, riparian, mountain, urban)

Each path leads through a series of simple yes/no questions about observable characteristics until reaching a specific tree species.

## Tree Coverage

This guide includes 165 trees found in California:
- Native California trees
- Common cultivated landscape trees
- Trees from all major regions of the state
- Trees representing various leaf types, habitats, and sizes

## Educational Value

This guide helps children develop:
- Observation skills
- Logical thinking through decision trees
- Understanding of California's natural environment
- Appreciation for biodiversity
- Connection to natural spaces

## Quality Assurance Guidelines

To maintain the high quality established in the broadleaf path, follow these guidelines when creating or updating identification paths:

### Numerical Consistency
1. **Count Verification**: Ensure all tree counts across different levels of the decision tree add up correctly
2. **Cross-Reference**: Verify that counts match between `tree-tracking.md` and path files
3. **Tree Placement**: Each tree should appear in exactly one leaf arrangement and type category
4. **Hierarchy Validation**: Child category counts should sum to their parent category total

### Structural Integrity
1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Maintain consistent indentation and formatting in ASCII tree diagrams
2. **Logical Splits**: Each decision point should create clean, logical divisions
3. **Balanced Distribution**: Avoid heavily imbalanced branches where possible
4. **Unique Paths**: Ensure each tree can be uniquely identified by following the path

### Content Quality
1. **Child-Friendly Language**: Use concrete, observational language suited for 8-10 year olds
2. **Feature Consistency**: Describe the same set of key features for each tree (leaf, bark, fruit, etc.)
3. **Special Cases**: Document exceptions and special classification notes (like Joshua Tree being treated as broadleaf)
4. **Seasonal Awareness**: Include identification tips for different times of year

## Enhancement Opportunities

The broadleaf path could be further improved in these ways:

### Usability Improvements
1. **Visual Aids**: Add simple illustrations at key decision points (leaf arrangements, shapes, edges)
2. **Color Coding**: Use color to distinguish different decision levels in the tree diagram
3. **Interactive Elements**: Create hyperlinks between related sections for easier navigation
4. **Quick Reference Cards**: Develop printable field cards for common tree families

### Accessibility Enhancements
1. **Alternative Text**: Include descriptive alternative text for any future visual elements
2. **Simplified Language**: Review for opportunities to make language even more child-friendly
3. **Audio Descriptions**: Develop audio guides describing key identification features
4. **Tactile Characteristics**: Add more information about texture and feel for visually impaired users

### Engagement Ideas
1. **Fun Facts**: Add more "Did you know?" content to spark curiosity
2. **Cultural Connections**: Expand information on indigenous uses of trees
3. **Ecological Relationships**: Note relationships with wildlife that kids might observe
4. **Seasonal Highlights**: Feature trees with spectacular seasonal characteristics (fall color, spring flowers)
5. **Scavenger Hunt**: Create themed tree-hunting activities based on characteristics

## Contributing

This project is complete with all 165 tree profiles created and formatted according to the standards defined in `instructions.md`. The decision tree paths have been developed and integrated into the main guide, with the broadleaf path serving as the gold standard example. The guide includes comprehensive path files for different leaf types (broadleaf, needle, scale), seasons, habitats, and reproductive features, providing multiple approaches to tree identification suitable for children.

      mood: '[Emotional/energetic quality of the card]'
      prompt_for_image_gen: 'Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short
        scene description].

        Use Yellow for foreground elements (inner world: Turtle) and White for background/environment
        (outer world: Village), with Iridescent highlights.

        Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors
        max, and minimalistic geometric forms.

        Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, centered, with a card
        title ''[CARD TITLE]'' in bold and a more subtle subtitle below that with
        the 8-bit code ''11011111'', without corner decorations or symbols.

        Feature [card_creature in the card_scene, key symbolic elements, e.g., moon
        phase, animal companions, symbolic object].

        The scene should evoke the mood of [MOOD KEYWORDS] and incorporate subtle
        seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer.

        Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction,
        emotionally resonant but compositionally clean.'

## Implementation Guidelines

When creating card names with mythological references:

1. **Focus on archetypal elements** rather than specific characters
2. **Use symbolic objects** from myths (mirror, crown, feather, ash) rather than character names
3. **Reference actions or states** from myths (slumber, flight, reflection) without naming who performed them
4. **Incorporate seasonal connections** that naturally align with mythological cycles
5. **Use adjectives that evoke** mythic qualities without direct naming
6. **Consider universal motifs** that appear across multiple mythological traditions
7. **Blend mythological elements** with other naming approaches (paradoxical pairing, poetic essence)
8. **Test the name's independence** - it should work even for someone unfamiliar with the reference

This approach maintains the rich mythological underpinnings while keeping the allusions light and indirect, with the "plausible deniability" requested. The card names still benefit from mythological depth but don't rely on recognizing specific characters or stories to appreciate their meaning.

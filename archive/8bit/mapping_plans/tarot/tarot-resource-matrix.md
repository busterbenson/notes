# Tarot Resource Signature Matrix

This document analyzes each tarot card in terms of its alignment with the six resource bits in our 8-bit oracle system.

## Bit Definitions
- **Bit 1 (Intuition)**: Do you trust your natural instincts to direct you down the right path?
- **Bit 2 (Ability)**: Do you have the skills and know-how required to address this question on your own?
- **Bit 3 (Capacity)**: Do your current circumstances provide enough time, space, and resources to address this?
- **Bit 4 (Expectations)**: Are you aligned with how cultural norms and expectations would want you to address this?
- **Bit 5 (Support)**: Do your closest relationships and community have your back in this?
- **Bit 6 (Options)**: Are the possible paths that you could choose from clear to you right now?

## Signature Scale
- **2**: Strongly present/emphasized in card meaning
- **1**: Present/moderately emphasized
- **0**: Absent/not emphasized
- **-1**: Actively lacking/reversed

## Bit Pattern Analysis

Based on these signatures, we can identify cards that strongly align with specific bit patterns. 

### Strongly Aligned Cards
- **The Moon (000000)**: Perfectly matches having no resources active
- **The Sun (111111)**: Perfectly matches having all resources active
- **The World**: Should have nearly all bits active (e.g., 111011 or 111101)
- **The Fool**: Strong intuition and options, weak elsewhere (e.g., 100001 or 100010)
- **The Magician**: Strong intuition, ability and options (e.g., 110010 or 110100)

### Challenging Alignments
- **The Tower**: Represents collapse, but which bits should remain active is ambiguous
- **The Devil**: Represents bondage, which suggests 'no' for many resources, but requires even parity

### Minor Arcana Progression
The numerical cards show a generally increasing resource activation, which aligns with placing them in ascending order through our sequence.

## Next Steps

1. Use these signatures to calculate the best bit pattern for each card
2. Prioritize Moon, Sun, and other clearly defined cards
3. Place numerical cards at regular intervals
4. Resolve conflicts by prioritizing cards with the most distinctive signatures

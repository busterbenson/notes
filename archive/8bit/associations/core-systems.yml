  # Archetype System Rules

    # How to map a particular card's first inner and outer worlds (bits 1-6) to the season (bits 7-8) 
    # to determine the archetype of a card. See archetype-guide.md for full details. 
    # When a card's inner and outer worlds map to the season of the card, the archetype is the Sage. And 
    # the subsequent seasons that follow are the Fool, the Hero, and the Monster, in that order.

  # Fractal Manifestation Framework
  # Every card could be said to have a fractal nature, which could be imagined as an additional several bits at the end.
  # This should be considered when interpreting cards, and card descriptions should be ambiguous enough to allow for interpretations at any of these fractal levels.

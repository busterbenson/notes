## Symbol Relationship Guidelines

When considering symbol relationships across hexagrams:

1. **Trigram Relationships**: Symbols should reflect their relationship to others that share the same trigram positions:
   - **Shared Inner Trigram**: Characters sharing the same inner trigram should have related but distinct qualities
   - **Shared Outer Trigram**: Environments sharing the same outer trigram should have common themes with unique expressions
   
2. **Opposite Relationships**: Symbols should create meaningful polarities with their opposite hexagram:
   - **Inner/Outer Character Contrasts**: Characters should embody complementary or opposite qualities
   - **Environmental Contrasts**: Settings should represent complementary or opposite spaces
   - **Symbolic Element Balancing**: Other symbols should create meaningful contrasts or completions

3. **Neighboring Relationships**: Symbols should connect naturally with hexagrams that differ by only one bit:
   - **Gradual Transformation**: Show how symbols evolve with small binary changes
   - **Narrative Continuity**: Create narrative connections between closely related hexagrams

## Usage Guidelines

When creating new narrative arcs or card descriptions:

1. **Consistency**: Use these symbols consistently throughout all cards in a hexagram's narrative arc
2. **Transformation**: Show how each symbol evolves through the Fool → Hero → Monster → Sage progression
3. **Integration**: Ensure inner world characters interact meaningfully with outer world environments
4. **Distinctive Identity**: Each hexagram should maintain a unique visual identity through its symbols
5. **Reference Codes**: Use the A-codes, E-codes, and S-codes for quick reference when creating new arcs

## Updating This Document

This document should be kept in sync with narrative arcs as they are created or modified. When adding a new hexagram:

1. Add a new row to the Hexagram Visual Symbols table in binary sort order
2. Assign new codes and add entries to the appropriate Symbol Reference tables
3. Ensure all symbols are clearly defined with their symbolic significance
4. Document key relationships with other hexagrams' symbols (shared trigrams, opposites, neighbors)

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Wonder's Edge"
      card_creature: "A child with snow-crystal eyes who stands at a nearly-completed ice palace, marveling at the final turret about to be placed rather than rushing to finish"
      question_posed: "How might you approach the final moments before completion with fresh eyes and childlike wonder rather than anxious hurrying?"
      card_scene: "A young figure stands in a winter landscape before an elaborate ice palace that lacks only its crowning spire. Rather than hurrying to complete it, the child examines the final crystal piece with innocent fascination, turning it in the moonlight to see how it creates different patterns of refraction. The new moon casts just enough light through parting clouds to illuminate the scene with a silvery glow. The nearly-finished structure already shows open doorways and windows, but the child seems more interested in the beauty of the threshold moment than in crossing it to completion. Around them, geometric snowflakes arrange themselves in patterns that mirror the crystalline structure they're creating, suggesting a natural unfolding rather than forced completion. The child wears simple clothing without the regalia of achievement or striving. Their breath forms visible patterns in the cold air that seem to ask questions rather than make declarations. At their feet, a small animal companion (fox or rabbit) observes with equal curiosity, neither urging completion nor preventing it, simply present in the threshold moment."
      universal_symbol: "The crystal â€“ structure on the verge of final formation, where potential is most visible"
      mood: "Innocent anticipation, threshold wonder, the fresh perspective that sees beauty in the moment just before culmination"

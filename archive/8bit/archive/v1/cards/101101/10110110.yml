  basic_info: 
    desc: "The Clinging Monster represents the overwhelming, consuming aspect of fire and attachment when they become destructive. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 30 (Li/The Clinging) expressed through Spring's qualities of growth and expansion - but pushed to dangerous excess. As the Monster in the cycle, this figure is consumed by brightness and attachment that exceed all capacity for control. With intuition and capacity but lacking ability in the inner world, and expectations and options but lacking support in the outer world, this figure is overwhelmed by the paradox of double fire energy. The monster emerges when attachment and illumination grow beyond all boundaries, showing what happens when desire transforms from a tool into a consuming force."

      card_creature: "A beast-like man whose attachment to flame has transformed him into fire itself, no longer controlling or directing the flames but becoming indistinguishable from them, blinded by his own light and consuming everything in his path"
      question_posed: "Where in your life might attachment and desire have become so intense that they are consuming rather than illuminating?"
      card_scene: "A grotesquely transformed man stands at the center of a spring forest that has erupted into wildfire, his body no longer merely holding or directing twin flames but having become indistinguishable from fire itself. His form pulses with magenta energy that burns with uncontrolled intensity, consuming rather than illuminating. A waxing moon hangs in the sky but is nearly eclipsed by the smoke and flames rising from the conflagration below. The man's eyes emit such intense light that they paradoxically create blindness – unable to see beyond his own brilliance. Unlike the female sage who contains fire, the female child who plays with it, or the male smith who directs it, this male figure has surrendered identity to become the flame itself. His masculine features are both enhanced and distorted by the fire, creating a terrifying visage of uncontrolled power. Spring growth that should represent new life has become mere fuel for the all-consuming fire, flowers wilting into ash moments after blooming. Two distinct fires that began separately have grown to merge into a single overwhelming inferno, feeding and intensifying each other beyond any possibility of control. Shattered remains of lamps and vessels designed to safely contain flame lie at his feet, destroyed by the very energy they were meant to hold. His expression shows a mixture of ecstasy and agony – simultaneously entranced by and trapped within his own brilliance. Animals flee in terror as the fire spreads in all directions, caring nothing for boundaries or purpose, existing only to consume more. The entire scene conveys the dangerous transformation that occurs when attachment and desire grow so intense that they consume both their object and their subject, leaving only destruction in their wake."
      universal_symbol: "The merged inferno – once-distinct flames that have combined into an uncontrollable conflagration, representing desire and attachment that have grown beyond all boundaries and purpose"
      mood: "Overwhelming intensity, destructive consumption, the blinding force that emerges when brightness and attachment grow so powerful they consume everything, including themselves"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a grotesquely transformed male figure at the center of a spring forest engulfed in wildfire, his body having become indistinguishable from the flames themselves, emitting light so intense it creates blindness.
      Use MAGENTA for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with purple and intense orange-red accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10110110' and card title 'CONSUMING FIRE' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waxing moon nearly eclipsed by smoke and flames, spring flowers wilting into ash moments after blooming, shattered remains of vessels meant to contain fire, and animals fleeing in terror from the spreading conflagration.
      The scene should evoke the mood of overwhelming intensity and destructive consumption, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring (Fire/Spring symbols, fire consuming spring growth, triple fire symbolism with spring's natural fire element amplified by the dual magenta fires).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the figure as masculine, with strong but distorted masculine features as he merges with the fire."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Luminous Harmony"
      card_creature: "A radiant sage who conducts unseen forces with subtle movements, creating perfect balance between realms of light and shadow, effortlessly weaving order from chaos through inner illumination rather than external power"
      question_posed: "How might your inner resources provide the harmony you seek when the outside world offers little support?"
      card_scene: "A serene sage stands at the boundary between two worlds in the gentle light of spring dawn. Their body glows with an internal luminescence, appearing almost translucent with white light while the world around them lies in darkness. A waxing moon hangs above, casting just enough light to reveal the stark contrast between the environments. On one side of the sage, barren land stretches toward the horizon with minimal vegetation and resources. On the other side, through what appears to be a permeable boundary of the sage's creation, lush spring growth flourishes. The sage makes no grand gestures but rather conducts with subtle finger movements, as if weaving invisible threads of harmony between the contrasting realms. Their eyes contain profound understanding, recognizing that balance emerges not from forcing change but from masterful orchestration of existing elements. Around their feet, scattered objects – stones, twigs, leaves – have arranged themselves in perfect geometric patterns that seem to radiate outward from where they stand. Despite the apparent poverty of resources in the environment, the sage has created a bridge of light that connects the realms of abundance and scarcity. Small creatures from both realms gather near, drawn to the harmony emanating from the sage's presence. The entire scene conveys that true peace comes not from external circumstances but from the masterful orchestration of inner resources against even the most challenging backdrop."
      universal_symbol: "The conductor's hands – perfect harmony created not through force but through subtle direction and inner illumination"
      mood: "Serene wisdom, masterful balance, the profound harmony that emerges when inner abundance gracefully accommodates external limitation"

  basic_info: 
    desc: "This card represents the shadow aspects that emerge when inner abundance becomes overwhelming against extreme external limitation. It embodies the paradox of having complete inner resources (intuition, ability, and capacity) without any external outlet or support, creating an unstable imbalance. In its Monster aspect in Winter, it reveals the dangerous intensity of inner light that becomes blinding and destructive when confined in complete outer darkness."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Overwhelming Light"
      card_creature: "A beast-like figure whose overwhelming inner radiance has become destructive, blinding rather than illuminating, contained within a wasteland that offers no outlet or resistance, their desperate movements creating fractures in reality itself"
      question_posed: "Where might your abundant inner resources be creating pressure and imbalance due to lack of external outlets or boundaries?"
      card_scene: "A grotesquely transformed figure stands in a desolate winter wasteland, their body emitting light so intense it appears painful and unstable. Unlike the sage's gentle glow, the child's playful radiance, or the hero's controlled illumination, this figure's light is chaotic and harmful – more like radioactive energy than divine brightness. Their features have begun to distort from the pressure of containing too much power in too small a vessel. The surrounding landscape is completely barren, offering no resistance, no outlet, and no counterbalance to the figure's overwhelming inner resources. A new moon is completely absent from the sky, leaving only a void that offers no reflection or regulation of the excess light. The figure appears trapped in a prison of their own creation – a circle of light so bright it has become a barrier rather than a bridge between realms. Where the other seasonal variations established harmony between light and dark, this figure has obliterated all darkness, creating a blinding imbalance. The absence of external resources has forced all energy inward, creating a pressurized system on the verge of catastrophic release. Fractures spread from where the figure stands, as if reality itself cannot contain the imbalance between inner abundance and outer limitation. Animals flee in terror from the overwhelming light that burns rather than nurtures. Objects nearby appear to warp and distort from proximity to the unstable energy. The figure's expression shows the pain of too much inner power with nowhere to direct it, trapped in an endless feedback loop of escalating intensity. The complete absence of external support or resistance has eliminated all possibility of true harmony, transforming peace into its monstrous shadow – tyrannical force that destroys the very balance it once created."
      universal_symbol: "The prison of light – destructive harmony created when inner abundance becomes overwhelming against complete external limitation"
      mood: "Dangerous intensity, unstable pressure, the destructive force that emerges when abundant inner resources have no external outlet or boundary to create balance"

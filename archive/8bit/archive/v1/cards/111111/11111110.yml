  basic_info: 
    desc: "The Creative Monster represents creativity taken to overwhelming excess. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 1 (Qian/The Creative) twisted by Spring's qualities of growth and expansion, creating a figure whose creative power has become uncontrollable and destructive. As the Monster in the cycle, this figure embodies what happens when creative energy lacks restraint - a force that creates so prolifically that it overwhelms and destroys. With all resources fully activated but distorted by Spring's unbounded energy, there is a terrifying power that creates without limit or discrimination."

      # 6 bits set to 1, so all archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral entity whose creative power has grown beyond control, neither masculine nor feminine but rather a pure embodiment of excessive generation. Their form constantly produces new growths and manifestations that overwhelm both their own body and everything around them in a terrifying display of creation without restraint."
      question_posed: "Where in your life has creative power become excessive, generating so much that it threatens to overwhelm and destroy what you value?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands in a spring landscape that is being overwhelmed by their own creative power. Their body appears to be constantly generating new growth – vines, branches, fractal patterns that extend outward at an alarming rate, consuming available space. The figure's form is difficult to discern beneath these proliferating manifestations, as if their essential self is being overwhelmed by their own creations. Around them, what began as a verdant spring scene has become chaotic – flowers grow to enormous proportions before withering under their own weight, trees sprout and split their trunks from too-rapid growth, and small creatures multiply beyond sustainable numbers. The waxing moon overhead seems to pulse in rhythm with the excessive growth below. The figure's hands continuously generate swirling energies that immediately manifest as physical forms, creating faster than natural processes can sustain. Their eyes show a mixture of creative ecstasy and horror at being unable to stop the process they've initiated. The ground beneath them cracks from the pressure of too many roots seeking purchase, while the air is thick with pollen, seeds, and spores – creation seeking yet more opportunities to replicate beyond bounds."
      universal_symbol: "A nuclear reaction - creative power beyond control, generation that destroys through excess"
      mood: "Overwhelming abundance, uncontrolled genesis, terrifying fertility"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral figure generating excessive growth that overwhelms a spring landscape.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and white for background/environment (outer world), with purple and intense spring green accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11111110' and card title 'THE UNRESTRAINED GENERATOR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a figure with fractal growths continuously emerging from their body, oversized flowers collapsing under their weight, splitting tree trunks, a waxing moon, and cracking ground from excessive root growth.
      The scene should evoke the mood of overwhelming abundance and uncontrolled genesis, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

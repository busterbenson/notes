    desc: "The Receptive Sage represents the pure embodiment of yielding wisdom. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 2 (Kun/The Receptive) expressed through Winter's qualities of stillness and potential. As the most integrated form of this hexagram, the Winter Sage embodies perfect receptivity and acceptance. With no bits activated, this figure represents conscious surrender, knowing when to be completely open to receive. The wisdom comes not from active pursuit but from the profound understanding that sometimes the greatest power lies in complete receptivity."

      # 0 bits set to 1, so all archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral sage of indeterminate form that seems to both absorb and reflect whatever approaches it. Neither clearly masculine nor feminine, neither young nor old, this being exists in a state of pure receptivity that transcends conventional boundaries. Their form shifts subtly like shadows cast by moonlight on snow, embodying the wisdom of perfect yielding."
      question_posed: "Where in your life might complete receptivity and yielding be the most powerful stance you could take?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral sage sits in absolute stillness at the center of a circular frozen lake under a moonless night sky. Their form is difficult to discern, appearing sometimes as solid and sometimes as transparent as the ice beneath them. The sage's open palms rest upon the ice, which acts as a perfect mirror reflecting the vast star field above. The scene is monochromatic - blacks, whites, and the subtlest grays - with no color to distract from the perfect emptiness. Around the lake's perimeter, snow-covered mountains form a protective circle, creating a sacred space of perfect stillness. No wind disturbs the scene; even the sage's breath leaves no visible trace in the cold air. A single empty bowl rests beside the figure, ready to receive whatever might come. The complete absence of activity paradoxically creates a sense of infinite potential, as if this void contains all possibilities in their unmanifested state."
      universal_symbol: "A perfect empty circle, representing both nothingness and infinite potential"
      mood: "Sacred emptiness, profound stillness, timeless patience"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral sage sitting on a perfectly reflective frozen lake under a starry night sky.
      Use black for foreground elements (inner world) and black for background/environment (outer world), with white and silver-gray accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000000' and card title 'THE VOID MIRROR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a perfect circular lake, surrounding mountains, an empty bowl, and a figure whose form is ambiguous and partially transparent.
      The scene should evoke the mood of sacred emptiness and profound stillness, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

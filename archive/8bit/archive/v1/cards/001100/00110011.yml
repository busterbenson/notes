      card_creature: "A masculine craftsman whose hands achieve perfect precision through years of devoted practice, neither overworking nor underworking his materials. His movements combine decisiveness with restraint, embodying the heroic mastery of knowing exactly when and where to apply just the right amount of force."
      question_posed: "Where might you apply masterful precision to achieve practical excellence rather than theoretical perfection?"
      card_scene: "A masculine figure works in a summer workshop open to the abundant natural world, his practiced hands making minute adjustments to a complex mechanism with confident precision. Unlike the sage's contemplative wisdom or the child's innocent discovery, his focus is on practical achievement through disciplined attention to detail. Around him are examples of his craft – objects that demonstrate perfect balance between form and function, neither overdone nor underdeveloped. His workbench contains an array of specialized tools, each worn in exactly the right places from years of use, showing that mastery comes through practical application rather than theoretical knowledge. The summer setting, with its full moon visible through the open workshop door, emphasizes that this precision occurs at the peak of natural abundance – not the first experimental growth of spring nor the concentrated essence of winter, but the mature fullness of summer. The craftsman's body shows evidence of years of practice – perhaps calluses on hands, or muscles developed through repetitive skilled movements. Unlike the obsessive perfectionist who gets lost in minutiae, his movements are efficient and purposeful, showing that his precision serves practical goals rather than theoretical ideals. Around his workshop, various calibration instruments maintain perfect accuracy – scales balanced to the microgram, levels that detect the slightest deviation, gauges that measure to fractions of a millimeter. The objects of his craft are being prepared for actual use, not merely display – their precision serves functional purpose in the world."
      universal_symbol: "The perfectly calibrated scale – precision maintained in perfect balance, neither excessive nor insufficient"
      mood: "Masterful skill, confident precision, the satisfying excellence that emerges from practical attention to detail"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a masculine craftsman in a summer workshop making precise adjustments to a complex mechanism with confident hands.
      Use blue for foreground elements (inner world) and red for background/environment (outer world), with gold and warm amber accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110011' and card title 'THE MASTER CALIBRATOR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature specialized tools worn in exactly the right places, perfect calibration instruments, completed work showing ideal balance of form and function, and a full moon visible through the open workshop door.
      The scene should evoke the mood of masterful skill and confident precision, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

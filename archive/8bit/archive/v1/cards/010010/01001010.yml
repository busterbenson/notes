    desc: "The Abysmal Fool represents the innocent curiosity and playful exploration of danger and water. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 29 (Kan/The Abysmal) expressed through Spring's qualities of growth and exploration. As the Fool in the cycle, this figure approaches depths and challenges with childlike wonder rather than fear. With technical ability but lacking intuition and capacity in the inner world, and support but lacking expectations and options in the outer world, this figure encounters the paradox of double water energy with fresh eyes. The fool discovers joy in exploring depths and dangers that others avoid, bringing innocent curiosity to what seems perilous."

      card_creature: "A wide-eyed young girl who leans precariously over twin whirlpools with innocent fascination rather than fear, reaching toward water creatures who invite further exploration, unaware of the dangers that would make others retreat"
      question_posed: "What might you discover if you approached challenges with childlike curiosity rather than adult caution?"
      card_scene: "A bright-eyed young girl balances on a log that stretches across two identical whirlpools in a spring-swollen stream, leaning forward with delighted fascination rather than fear. Unlike the female sage's serene balance, the girl has one foot slipping and arms windmilling for balance, yet her expression shows only wonder and excitement at the swirling patterns below. A waxing moon casts playful light that dances across the water's surface, creating patterns that seem to respond to the girl's laughter. Below her, water creatures – fish, frogs, and more fantastical beings – swim at the edges of the whirlpools, seeming to invite rather than warn the child. The water itself has a green, luminous quality that makes the depths appear magical rather than threatening. Around the stream, spring flowers bloom in unusual abundance, creating the impression of a magical rather than dangerous place. The girl has created a makeshift boat from leaves and twigs that floats nearby, suggesting experimental play with crossing the water. Scattered on the bank are simple tools for water exploration – a jar for collecting specimens, a stick for testing depth – approaches to water with curiosity rather than fear. Several stepping stones form an alternative path across the stream, but she has deliberately chosen the more precarious log for the thrill of discovery. Other children can be seen in the background, some watching with hesitation, others beginning to approach with growing curiosity. The entire scene conveys the innocent wonder that emerges when danger is encountered with fresh eyes, before learning to fear it – seeing not the peril but the possibilities for discovery and play."
      universal_symbol: "The balancing log – the precarious yet thrilling path that reveals wonders hidden to those who approach life with excessive caution"
      mood: "Childlike wonder, innocent fascination, the joyful discovery that emerges when challenges and depths are approached with beginner's mind rather than learned fear"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a bright-eyed female child balancing precariously on a log across two identical whirlpools in a spring-swollen stream, leaning forward with delighted fascination rather than fear at the swirling patterns below.
      Use GREEN for foreground elements (inner world) and GREEN for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and vibrant yellow-green accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '01001010' and card title 'PLAYFUL DEPTHS' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waxing moon casting playful light that dances on water, curious water creatures (fish, frogs, fantastical beings) swimming at whirlpool edges, abundant spring flowers creating a magical atmosphere, and a makeshift boat of leaves and twigs floating nearby.
      The scene should evoke the mood of childlike wonder and innocent fascination, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring (Fire/Spring symbols, new growth, flowing water freed from winter ice, the energetic qualities of spring floods).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the child as a young girl, with feminine features and playful expression."

    desc: "The Abysmal Sage represents the profound wisdom that emerges when we fully understand the nature of danger and water. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 29 (Kan/The Abysmal) expressed through Winter's qualities of stillness and reflection. As the most integrated form of this hexagram, the Winter Sage embodies deep understanding of how repeated challenges strengthen us. With technical ability but lacking intuition and capacity in the inner world, and support but lacking expectations and options in the outer world, this figure navigates the paradox of double water energy with transcendent awareness. The sage understands that water, like danger, can be both life-sustaining and life-threatening - appreciating its depths without being consumed by them."

      card_creature: "A serene feminine sage whose body appears composed of flowing water yet remains unbroken by the ice surrounding her, whose eyes contain the wisdom of countless survived dangers, perfectly balanced between twin abysses without fear"
      question_posed: "What wisdom might emerge if you fully embraced the challenges before you instead of avoiding them?"
      card_scene: "A serene female sage stands on a narrow ice bridge spanning two identical abysses in the heart of winter. Her body appears to be partially composed of flowing water that somehow maintains human form without freezing or dispersing, embodying the paradox of stability within perpetual flow. Her long silver hair moves like gentle currents, blending with her water-like essence. A new moon provides minimal light, leaving much in darkness, yet the woman navigates with perfect confidence. Below her, identical whirlpools spiral downward in mirror images, representing the double water energy of this card. Unlike someone who might tremble at the precipice, she stands precisely at the most dangerous point with perfect equilibrium, neither avoiding nor recklessly engaging with the peril. The winter landscape contains frozen waterfalls suspended in mid-flow, capturing the momentary stillness that winter brings to water's perpetual movement. Scattered around the sage are simple tools for water navigation – a boat hook, rope, divining rod – suggesting practical skill rather than mystical powers. Her expression shows neither fear nor recklessness but rather profound understanding – recognizing danger without being controlled by it. Her robes flow like water yet provide perfect protection against the winter cold, another embodiment of paradox. Small fish can be seen swimming within the abysses below, suggesting life and possibility within apparent danger. The surface of the narrow ice bridge shows cracks that have been repeatedly repaired, indicating that she has faced and overcome these challenges many times before. The entire scene conveys the profound wisdom that emerges when danger is neither denied nor feared but understood as an essential teacher and transformer."
      universal_symbol: "The ice bridge – the narrow path of wisdom that allows safe passage between twin dangers when navigated with awareness and skill"
      mood: "Profound serenity, transcendent understanding, the luminous wisdom that emerges when danger and challenge are neither feared nor sought but fully comprehended"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a serene female sage standing on a narrow ice bridge spanning two identical abysses in the heart of winter, her body partially composed of flowing water that maintains human form without freezing.
      Use GREEN for foreground elements (inner world) and GREEN for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and deep blue accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '01001000' and card title 'WISDOM IN DEPTHS' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a new moon providing minimal light, twin whirlpools spiraling beneath in mirror images, frozen waterfalls suspended in mid-flow, and small fish swimming within the apparent danger of the abysses.
      The scene should evoke the mood of profound serenity and transcendent understanding, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter (Air/Winter symbols, crystalline ice formations, the paradox of flowing water and frozen forms, breath visible in cold air).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the sage as feminine, with graceful features and a serene, wise expression."

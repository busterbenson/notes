LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "SOLITARY FLAME" (10000000)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the essence of the Solitary Flame card - representing pure intuition preserved in isolation, the knowing that exists without external validation or means to manifest.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- MUST INCLUDE A CLEAR BORDER with all content 200px from all edges 
- All artwork and elements MUST remain within this 200px border - NOTHING should extend beyond this border
- This means the actual illustration area is 800x1600 pixels centered on the card
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Red (for inner world character and single flame)
- Accent: Iridescent silver-blue highlights (representing the Sage archetype)
- Outer World: Black/deep blues for the cave and winter landscape
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A feminine sage with alabaster skin and flowing silver hair that seems to merge with the darkness
- Her body wrapped in layers of midnight blue fabric that ripple like water
- Eyes closed in deep meditation, yet conveying intense awareness of hidden truths
- Hands cupped before her, holding/surrounding a small hovering red flame
- Her posture perfectly still, serene despite complete isolation
- Face conveying peaceful certainty - the confidence of inner knowing without external validation
- Silver-blue iridescent highlights in her hair and at the edges of her form

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- A vast crystal cave of ice and darkness, walls reflecting the single flame as countless points of light
- Outside the cave entrance, a glimpse of endless winter landscape stretching to infinity
- Completely moonless sky visible beyond the cave opening
- No signs of life, movement or habitation in the landscape
- A frozen compass lying near the figure, its needle pointing toward her rather than north
- Cave walls with geometric crystal formations catching and refracting the flame's light
- The darkness creating a womb-like, protective rather than threatening atmosphere

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete Dark Moon icon in upper right corner - a perfect black circle
- This represents the Dark Moon Deepening phase - the moment of complete darkness before any emergence
- The dark moon icon echoed in the moonless sky visible beyond the cave entrance

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Solitary flame: A small red fire hovering between the sage's hands, the only warm color in the scene, representing isolated intuition
- Crystal cave: Geometric ice formations creating a sanctuary where vision can develop protected from the harsh outer world
- Frozen compass: An antique navigation tool with its needle pointing toward the sage rather than north, suggesting internal guidance when external markers fail
- Moonless night sky: The complete absence of external light, showing a time when one must rely entirely on inner illumination

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Sacred solitude - the profound peace that comes from complete self-reliance
- Patient certainty - knowing a truth that cannot yet be expressed or validated
- Protective darkness - the necessity of isolation for certain kinds of development
- Suspended potential - the feeling of a turning point that hasn't quite arrived

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "SOLITARY FLAME" in bold, centered, all caps
- "10000000" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the sage and flame as central focal point, slightly offset within the cave setting

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create dramatic contrast between the red flame and the dark blues/blacks of the cave
- Use minimal elements to convey maximum symbolic meaning
- Apply halftone or similar effects for the points of reflected light throughout the cave
- Balance the stillness of the figure with subtle movement in the fabric and flame
- Ensure the darkness feels protective and womb-like rather than threatening

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The necessity of isolation for certain kinds of knowing
- The preservation of intuitive vision when manifestation isn't yet possible
- The return to inner guidance when external validation is absent
- The turning point that exists in perfect stillness
- The paradox that pure potential exists in apparent emptiness

This card represents the isolated flame of intuition preserved in the darkness of winter - the knowing that exists without external validation or means to manifest. The image should evoke a sense of sacred solitude and the quiet certainty of inner truth awaiting its moment to emerge.

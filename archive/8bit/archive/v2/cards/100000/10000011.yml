      card_creature: "A masculine hero with sun-bronzed skin and vibrant red hair that moves like flames around his head. His form is powerful yet graceful, with the balanced musculature of a master martial artist or dancer. His hands glow with the same red energy as his hair, as if pure intuition flows directly through them into creative action. His eyes hold a calm, centered focus - neither strained nor distracted, but completely present. His expression conveys perfect flow state - the total alignment of intuition and action without the interference of doubt. He wears minimal clothing in shades of gold that accentuates rather than hides his form, suggesting the transparency of one who has nothing to conceal and no need for external protection or validation."
      question_posed: "Where in your life is intuition asking to be expressed through immediate, confident action?"
      card_scene: "A masculine figure stands atop a high summer cliff overlooking a vast ocean at the exact moment of a powerful action - either drawing a bow, casting an artistic work, or completing a perfect dive. The figure is caught in the precise instant where intention transforms into manifestation, where thought becomes form. Below, the ocean forms a perfect wave that mirrors the figure's arc of movement. The landscape is minimal but vibrant with summer energy - golden light bathes everything, creating an atmosphere of heightened reality where intuition and action become one continuous flow. A bolt of red lightning connects the sky to the figure's hands, representing the direct channel between pure intuition and masterful expression. The New Moon Emerging phase is represented by a thin crescent visible in the bright summer sky, gaining definition and direction. The entire scene conveys the rare and powerful moment when intuitive knowledge bypasses all hesitation and flows directly into perfect action - the hero's capacity to manifest without self-consciousness or doubt."
      universal_symbol: "The lightning strike - representing the direct, instantaneous connection between intuitive knowing and physical manifestation"
      mood: "Effortless mastery, perfect flow, the exhilarating alignment of intention and action"

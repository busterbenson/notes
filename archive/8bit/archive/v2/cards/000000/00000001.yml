  basic_info:
    desc: "This card represents the void as a consuming force that simultaneously creates space for new beginnings. The 00000001 pattern captures the moment when absolute emptiness begins its transformation. In this Fall aspect, it manifests as the Monster who embodies the devouring yet generative aspect of darkness. As resources are consumed and returned to nothingness, the first seeds of creation emerge. The Dark Moon Emerging phase perfectly mirrors this - the transition point from complete darkness to the first hint of light, where destruction and creation become the same process."

      card_name: 'Devouring Void'
      card_creature: "A neutral monster whose form appears as an amorphous darkness with a consuming maw. Neither distinctly male nor female, this entity exists as a shadow that both devours and creates. Its edges constantly shift and flow, simultaneously absorbing everything around it while paradoxically allowing the faintest glimmers of new growth to emerge from its darkest depths."
      question_posed: "What must be completely consumed or released before new growth can emerge in your life?"
      card_scene: "A formless darkness occupies the center of the image, appearing as a vast, consuming maw that absorbs everything in its vicinity. Around this void, autumn leaves and decaying matter swirl as if being pulled into the darkness. The background suggests a forest in late fall, with bare trees and a ground covered in decay. Yet within the darkest center of the void, barely perceptible, are tiny seeds and the faintest glimmer of new potential. The scene creates a stark threshold - a boundary between existence and non-existence where decay and rebirth become indistinguishable. At the edge of the darkness is what appears to be an event horizon - a point of no return where matter stretches and distorts as it's pulled into the void. The Dark Moon Emerging phase is represented by a barely visible sliver of light at the very center of the darkness, suggesting that from the deepest consumption comes the first spark of creation. The entire composition evokes Fall's essence - the necessary destruction that precedes rebirth."
      universal_symbol: "The devouring maw - representing the necessary consumption and dissolution that precedes all new creation"
      mood: "Threshold awareness, transformative dissolution, the necessary end that contains a beginning"
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of an amorphous void with a devouring maw-like quality, absorbing autumn elements while paradoxically containing the first spark of creation.

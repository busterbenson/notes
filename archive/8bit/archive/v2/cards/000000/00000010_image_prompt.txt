LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "UNWRITTEN BEGINNING" (00000010)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the essence of the Unwritten Beginning card - representing the pristine potential of emptiness right before the first creative act, the empty canvas where all possibility exists.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- NO decorative borders or frames around the illustration
- Allow natural margins (5-8% of width) between content and card edges
- Content should NOT touch the very edges - leave appropriate breathing room
- The illustration should use traditional tarot card-style layout with natural margins
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Black (for both inner world character and outer world environment)
- Accent: Bright turquoise/aqua highlights (representing the Fool archetype)
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights
- Gradual transition from darkness to pristine white space

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A gender-neutral fool with a youthful, fluid appearance poised on the threshold of creation
- Neither masculine nor feminine, with an innocent quality that transcends gender
- The figure should stand with one foot lifted as if taking the first step on an unmarked path
- They hold a perfectly blank canvas or empty page in one hand - unmarked but containing infinite potential
- Their other hand might be slightly raised, as if about to make the first mark or gesture
- Their eyes should be wide with wonder, embodying beginner's mind - seeing everything for the first time
- Their expression should blend anticipation with serenity - the perfect balance of excitement and calm before creation
- Their form should appear light, as if barely manifest - the first embodiment of possibility

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- A transitional landscape that shifts from complete darkness on one side to pristine white emptiness on the other
- The figure stands at the threshold between these realms - the exact point of emergence
- The background suggests early spring - bare branches with the faintest hint of green buds beginning to form
- A few tiny seedlings might be emerging from otherwise barren ground
- Where the figure's foot touches the ground, the first hint of a path begins to form, yet stretches ahead unmarked
- Small ripples or patterns in the empty space suggest infinite possibilities waiting to be manifested
- The overall scene should evoke a sense of hushed anticipation, as if the whole world is holding its breath before the first act of creation

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete new moon icon in upper right corner - a thin crescent of light against darkness
- This represents the New Moon Birthing phase - the first visible sliver of light emerging from darkness
- The thin crescent should echo the curve of the blank page or canvas the figure holds

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Blank canvas/empty page: A pristine white surface representing unlimited creative potential
- First sliver of moon: The thin crescent representing the initial emergence from darkness
- Seedling breaking through soil: The first tender shoot emerging from the earth, representing new growth
- Unmarked path: A path that begins to form beneath the figure but remains undefined ahead, representing the open future
- Faint green buds: Almost imperceptible hints of green on otherwise bare branches, representing spring's awakening
- Dawn light: A subtle suggestion of the first light of day breaking over the horizon

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Innocent wonder - the pure, unfiltered experience of seeing everything as new
- Delicate emergence - the fragile, tentative quality of beginnings
- Breathless anticipation - the moment of suspense before creation begins
- Limitless potential - the sense that anything and everything is possible

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "UNWRITTEN BEGINNING" in bold, centered, all caps
- "00000010" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the figure at the threshold point between darkness and light

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create a delicate balance between emptiness and the first hints of form
- Use minimal elements to suggest maximum potential
- Apply texture that enhances the feeling of pristine newness
- Emphasize the threshold quality - the precise moment of emergence
- Ensure the fool aspect feels innocent and open rather than naive or simplistic

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The beginner's mind as the most creative state of consciousness
- The threshold moment before creation as filled with pure potential
- Spring's essence as the season of fresh beginnings and new growth
- The fool archetype as one who approaches life with innocent wonder
- The New Moon Birthing as the first visible emergence of light from darkness

This card represents the pristine potential right before the first mark is made - the empty canvas where all creation is possible. The image should evoke both the anticipation of beginning and the perfect emptiness that contains all possibilities.

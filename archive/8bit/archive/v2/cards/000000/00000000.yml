  basic_info:
    desc: "This card represents the deepest void where all potential lies dormant. The all-zeros pattern embodies complete emptiness - an absence of all resources, both inner and outer. In this Winter aspect, it manifests as the Sage who has transcended even darkness itself. This figure doesn't fear the void but instead understands it as the necessary foundation of all creation. The Dark Moon Deepening phase perfectly mirrors this energy - the moment of complete darkness before any emergence. Like the void that preceded the universe, this card speaks to the paradoxical nature of nothingness as the source of everything."

      card_name: 'Void Mirror'
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral sage whose body appears as a silhouette of stars against deeper darkness, merging with the void yet somehow distinct from it. Their eyes are not visible features but rather perfect circular voids that somehow reflect the unlimited potential contained in absolute emptiness. Their form seems both ancient and timeless, a consciousness that has learned to exist in perfect harmony with nothingness."
      question_posed: "What profound wisdom might emerge if you fully embraced the darkness you've been avoiding?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands perfectly still at the center of absolute darkness. Their form is defined only by an outline of tiny stars, creating a silhouette of cosmic light against the even deeper void behind them. There is no landscape, no horizon, only graduated shades of darkness extending in all directions. Where the figure's eyes should be, there are instead two perfectly circular voids that somehow reflect the observer's own gaze back at them. In one hand, the figure holds what appears to be a mirror made of polished obsidian that reflects nothing yet seems to contain everything. The figure's posture conveys neither fear nor discomfort in this lightless realm, but rather a profound understanding and acceptance of darkness as the necessary foundation of all existence. Around their feet, what initially appears to be simple ripples in water reveals itself to be ripples in space-time itself, as if the void is a fluid medium through which all potential must pass. The dark moon is represented by complete absence - a void within the void. The entire scene embodies the Dark Moon Deepening phase - the deepest moment of darkness before any emergence, conveying a sense of vastness and infinite potential rather than emptiness or negation - the darkness not as an end but as the beginning of all possibility."
      universal_symbol: "The obsidian mirror - reflecting nothing yet containing everything, representing the paradox of emptiness as the source of all potential"
      mood: "Profound acceptance, mysterious anticipation, serene recognition that all creation emerges from darkness"

# Missing Characteristics for Cosmologies

Below are 12 key characteristics that should be added to the CSV to properly represent the newly added cosmologies:

1. **Information as Fundamental**: "Reality is fundamentally composed of information rather than matter, energy, or consciousness"
   - Essential for: Information-Theoretic Cosmology (R)
   - Would be DB for: Scientific Materialism, Consciousness-First

2. **Spontaneous Emergence**: "Reality emerges spontaneously from emptiness without requiring a creator"
   - Essential for: Traditional Daoist Cosmology (R)
   - Would be DB for: Young Earth Creationism, Theistic Evolution

3. **Complementary Forces**: "Apparent opposites are complementary forces in dynamic balance rather than conflicting principles"
   - Essential for: Traditional Daoist Cosmology (R)
   - Relevant for: Jain Cosmology (NR)

4. **Multi-Perspectival Truth**: "Reality can only be understood through multiple complementary perspectives"
   - Essential for: Jain Cosmology (R)
   - Relevant for: Agnostic Spiritual Seeker (NR)

5. **Continuous Divine Creation**: "The universe is recreated at every moment through divine will"
   - Essential for: Islamic Philosophical Cosmology (R)
   - Would be DB for: Deism, Scientific Materialism

6. **Ancestral Participation**: "Ancestors actively participate in present community life"
   - Essential for: Traditional African Cosmologies (R)
   - Relevant for: Indigenous Relational Worldview (NR)

7. **Cyclical Time**: "Time is fundamentally cyclical rather than linear"
   - Essential for: Traditional African Cosmologies, Jain Cosmology (R)
   - Relevant for: Traditional Daoist Cosmology (NR)

8. **Divination Causality**: "Divination systems reveal invisible causes of visible events"
   - Essential for: Traditional African Cosmologies (R)
   - Would be DB for: Scientific Materialism

9. **Vital Force Cosmology**: "A vital force or energy animates and flows through all beings"
   - Essential for: Traditional African Cosmologies (R)
   - Relevant for: New Age Spiritualism, Animism (NR)

10. **Transcendence of Subject-Object**: "Reality transcends the subject-object division of ordinary experience"

12. **Non-Action Alignment**: "The optimal approach to existence is alignment with natural processes (wu-wei)"
    - Essential for: Traditional Daoist Cosmology (R)
    - Relevant for: Indigenous Relational Worldview (NR)

Adding these characteristics would provide more accurate representation of these cosmological perspectives and allow for better differentiation between similar worldviews.

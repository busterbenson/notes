# Core Cosmologies

This document describes the 42 core cosmologies identified in the simplified cosmological framework. These represent fundamental perspectives on the nature of reality, organized by their primary metaphysical foundations.

## Physical/Material Reality Cosmologies

### Young Earth Perspectives

**Young Earth - Appearance of Age**  
You believe God created the universe recently (within the past 10,000 years) but with the appearance of greater age. Just as Adam was created as an adult rather than an infant, the entire cosmos was created with an apparent history already built in for functional and theological purposes, reflecting God's wisdom and sovereignty.

**Young Earth - Catastrophism**  
You believe Earth is young (less than 10,000 years old), but its geology has been dramatically shaped by catastrophic events (especially Noah's global Flood), which explain phenomena like the fossil record, geological strata, and features that mainstream scientists wrongly attribute to long ages. This framework provides a scientifically coherent alternative to uniformitarian geology while remaining faithful to scripture.

**Young Earth - Biblical Literalism**  
You believe in a strict, literal reading of Genesis as God's inerrant word, with Earth being approximately 6,000-10,000 years old, created in six 24-hour days. You see apparent scientific evidence for an older Earth (like radiometric dating or distant starlight) as either flawed due to incorrect assumptions or created with age by God as part of His perfect design.

### Scientific Materialism

**Scientific - Reductive Materialism**  
You value the elegance and explanatory power of understanding all phenomena, including consciousness, as ultimately reducible to fundamental physical particles and forces. This empirically-grounded position has consistently advanced human knowledge by revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of increasingly complex systems, from chemical reactions to neural activity, without requiring additional non-physical elements.

**Scientific - Emergent Materialism**  
You recognize that while the universe is fundamentally physical, complex systems develop genuinely novel properties not predictable from analysis of their components alone. Consciousness, life, and social phenomena represent emergent levels of organization requiring their own descriptive frameworks. This nuanced position honors both the physical foundation of reality and the genuine novelty that arises at higher levels of complexity.

**Scientific - Pragmatic Instrumentalism**  
You see scientific theories as powerful tools for prediction and control rather than literal descriptions of an ultimate reality. The value of materialism lies in its extraordinary practical utility and predictive success, not in metaphysical claims about what "really" exists. This pragmatic approach sidesteps unresolvable metaphysical debates while maintaining the full practical power of scientific methodology.

**Scientific - Poetic Naturalism**  
You embrace multiple valid ways of talking about reality at different levels (physical, biological, psychological), all compatible with a fundamental physical world. These aren't merely convenient fictions but genuine ways of capturing real patterns in nature that matter for different purposes. This layered approach provides a rich, scientifically grounded framework for understanding reality at multiple scales.

### Deism

**Deism - Classical**  
You believe God created the universe with perfectly designed natural laws and then stepped back, letting it run like a cosmic clock. God neither intervenes nor desires worship; reason and observation of nature are the paths to understanding the Creator.

**Deism - Modern**  
While you believe a creator initiated the universe, you're open to limited divine interaction or periods of involvement. You might accept ideas like a creator who occasionally fine-tunes cosmic parameters or who evolves along with creation.

**Deism - Scientific**  
You see the fundamental laws and constants of physics as evidence of design, particularly their fine-tuning that permits life. Your concept of God is more abstract—perhaps as the ground of mathematics or the source of natural law—rather than a personal being.

## Divine Reality Cosmologies

### Theistic Evolution

**Theistic Evolution - Evolutionary Creationism**  
You believe God created through natural processes, with evolution being God's method of creating biological diversity. Science describes "how" while faith explains "why" and "who." You see no conflict between well-established scientific findings and belief in divine purpose.

**Theistic Evolution - Progressive Creation**  
You believe God intervened at key moments in Earth's history, particularly to create new "kinds" of life or to guide evolution at critical junctures. While accepting the universe's ancient age, you may be skeptical of some evolutionary mechanisms being sufficient without divine guidance.

**Theistic Evolution - Teilhardian**  
Following Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's vision, you see evolution as a divinely guided process moving toward greater complexity and consciousness, ultimately culminating in the "Omega Point" where creation reaches divine unification. Evolution has a spiritual direction, not just a material explanation.

### Polytheism

**Polytheism - Henotheism**  
While acknowledging many gods exist, you primarily worship or connect with one deity, perhaps as your patron or as particularly relevant to your life. Other gods are real but not the focus of your spiritual practice.

**Polytheism - Reconstructionist**  
You practice a revived form of ancient polytheistic religion, attempting to reconstruct historical worship practices while adapting them to contemporary life. You seek authentic connection to ancestral traditions and deities.

**Polytheism - Classical**  
You believe in multiple distinct deities with different domains, personalities, and powers, similar to ancient traditions like Greek, Norse, or Egyptian pantheons. These gods interact with each other and with humanity in complex ways.

**Polytheism - Hard**  
You believe each deity is absolutely distinct, with separate consciousness, will, and essence. Gods are not archetypes or aspects of a single divine force but truly independent beings with their own agendas and personalities.

### Pantheism

**Pantheism - Scientific**  
You revere the universe and nature as revealed by science, finding spiritual fulfillment in contemplating cosmic evolution, natural beauty, and the laws of physics, without supernatural beliefs. The universe itself is worthy of reverence.

**Pantheism - Monistic**  
You believe all apparent diversity and multiplicity are ultimately illusory; there is only one reality, and that reality is divine. Individual existence is a kind of dream or misperception of the fundamental oneness.

**Pantheism - Classical**  
Following Spinoza, you believe God and Nature are identical—there is only one substance which can be called either "God" or "Nature." Everything that exists is a mode or expression of this single divine reality.

## Consciousness/Mind Cosmologies

### Non-Dual Perspectives

**Non-Dual - Buddhist Emptiness**  
You recognize that all phenomena lack inherent existence (svabhāva) and arise interdependently. You use philosophical analysis and meditation to reveal how apparent reality is empty of independent existence. Through realizing emptiness, you find freedom from attachment to fixed views, experiencing reality beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence.

**Non-Dual - Direct Experience Zen**  
You emphasize immediate, direct experience of reality beyond words and concepts. Your practice involves breaking through dualistic thinking through meditation, koans, and spontaneous awareness. You find the sacred in ordinary activities with complete presence, recognizing your original nature in sudden moments of insight when conceptual thinking drops away.

**Non-Dual - Vedantic**  
You recognize that Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (your true self) are fundamentally identical. The apparent plurality and separateness we experience is maya (cosmic illusion), and liberation comes through directly realizing "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art). This approach emphasizes the illusory nature of the manifest world and physical existence, seeking transcendence through knowledge and meditation that reveals the unchanging reality behind appearances.

**Non-Dual - Tantric**  
You understand reality as the dynamic play of consciousness (Shiva) and energy (Shakti), where the universe is consciousness expressing and knowing itself. Through recognition of your true nature, you experience the world as inseparable from your own awareness. Unlike Vedantic approaches that may view the world as illusion to transcend, Tantric non-dualism embraces the physical world as sacred manifestation, using ritual, embodied practices, and energy work to realize the divine within everyday experience rather than beyond it.

**Non-Dual - Taoist Harmony**  
You perceive the cosmos as the natural flow of complementary forces (yin and yang) that form an indivisible whole. The Tao cannot be grasped conceptually but can be aligned with through naturalness and non-action (wu-wei). By transcending dualistic thinking and following the way of nature, you find harmony within the ever-changing patterns of existence.

**Non-Dual - Contemporary**  
Influenced by various traditions but without their historical-cultural elements, you focus on the direct recognition that awareness is not personal but universal, and that all apparent separation is conceptual. Your approach emphasizes practical insights that dissolve the subject-object division in everyday experience, seeing through the illusion of a separate self without elaborate metaphysical frameworks.

### Consciousness-First Approaches

**Consciousness-First - Yogacara**  
You understand consciousness as having eight aspects, including store-consciousness (ālaya-vijñāna) that contains the seeds of all phenomena. The apparent external world is a manifestation of mind, not separate from it. This scholarly, philosophical Buddhist approach analyzes the structures of consciousness, emphasizing that we only ever experience our mental representations, not an independent external world.

**Consciousness-First - Vajrayana**  
You experience reality as the inseparable unity of emptiness and luminous awareness. Through tantric practices, you directly realize the nature of mind as primordially pure, spontaneously present, and unobstructed. This experiential Tibetan Buddhist approach emphasizes transformative practices rather than philosophical analysis, using visualization, mantra, and energy work to realize consciousness as fundamental.

**Consciousness-First - Analytical Idealism**  
You understand the universe as the extrinsic appearance of processes in universal consciousness. Individual minds are "dissociated alters" of this cosmic mind, similar to how multiple personalities can emerge within one psyche. This view resolves paradoxes of consciousness while remaining compatible with scientific evidence.

**Consciousness-First - Quantum Idealism**  
You recognize that quantum physics suggests a universe where consciousness and observation play a fundamental role. Observer effects, non-locality, and wave function collapse all indicate that mind is primary, not secondary. This is not just interest in quantum physics, but specifically the view that quantum phenomena demonstrate the primacy of consciousness over matter.

**Consciousness-First - Transcendental Idealism**  
Following Kant's insight, you recognize that the structures of consciousness shape our experience of reality in ways we cannot transcend. Space, time, and causality are features of how minds organize experience, not objective features independent of consciousness. This isn't denying a real world, but acknowledging the critical role of consciousness in constituting the world we experience.

**Consciousness-First - Neutral Monism**  
You understand reality's fundamental nature as neither exclusively mental nor physical but a neutral substance that manifests as both mind and matter depending on how it's observed. Consciousness and physicality are two aspects of the same underlying reality—a perspective that harmoniously bridges the apparent divide between subjective experience and objective description.

### Gnostic Perspectives

**Gnostic - Classical Gnosticism**  
You believe the material world was created by an imperfect or malevolent Demiurge, not the true God. The divine spark within humans is trapped in matter, and salvation comes through secret knowledge (gnosis) of your divine origins.

**Gnostic - Philosophical Dualism**  
You see reality as fundamentally divided between mind/spirit and matter, or between good and evil principles. These opposing forces exist in tension, and spiritual progress involves aligning with higher principles against lower ones.

**Gnostic - Modern Matrix Skepticism**  
You suspect everyday reality is a sophisticated illusion or control system hiding a more fundamental reality. Unlike the Simulation Hypothesis which proposes technological creators running a computer simulation for research or entertainment, Matrix Skepticism sees our false reality as spiritually oppressive or metaphysically deceptive, with liberation requiring spiritual awakening rather than scientific understanding.

## Spiritual/Energetic Forces Cosmologies

### New Age Approaches

**New Age - Consciousness-Focused**  
You believe consciousness creates reality, with thoughts and intentions directly affecting the material world. Practices like the Law of Attraction, manifestation techniques, and visualization are central to your worldview.

**New Age - Energy-Based**  
You focus on subtle energies, chakras, auras, and vibrational frequencies. You might work with crystal healing, Reiki, or other energy modalities, seeing reality as fundamentally vibrational in nature.

**New Age - Evolutionary Consciousness**  
You believe humanity is evolving toward higher consciousness and greater spiritual awareness. We are in a planetary shift (like the Age of Aquarius), where collective awakening will transform society and our relationship with the cosmos.

**New Age - Eclectic Synthesis**  
You draw from multiple spiritual traditions, ancient wisdom, and modern metaphysics, creating a personalized path. You value direct experience over dogma and believe in finding your own truth among many valid perspectives.

### Animist Perspectives

**Animist - Traditional**  
You believe all things (animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems) possess spirits, consciousness, or personhood, forming a community of beings with agency beyond humans. Proper relationships with these beings involve respect, reciprocity, and ritual acknowledgment.

**Animist - Neo-Animism**  
You've developed a contemporary animistic practice that recognizes consciousness or personhood in natural entities, perhaps blending traditional ideas with modern ecological awareness, phenomenology, or systems thinking.

**Animist - Panpsychism**  
You believe consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe, present to some degree in all things, even at the subatomic level. Unlike idealist views that see matter as emergent from consciousness, panpsychism maintains that consciousness is an intrinsic property of matter itself, varying in complexity and expression across the physical spectrum.

### Indigenous Worldviews

**Indigenous - Place-Based Knowledge**  
You participate in a living relationship with the specific lands and ecosystems that have sustained indigenous people for countless generations. You know that authentic understanding comes from this deep connection to particular places, each with their own needs, spirits, and teachings that reveal themselves to those who approach with proper respect and attentiveness over time.

**Indigenous - Kinship Cosmology**  
You recognize humans as just one kind of person in a vast extended family that includes animal persons, plant persons, stone persons, and other beings. This isn't metaphorical but literal—these other-than-human persons have their own languages, societies, and intentions. Proper living requires maintaining respectful family relationships with all these relatives through specific cultural protocols developed over generations.

**Indigenous - Ceremonial Reality**  
You participate in ceremonies not as symbolic rituals but as real actions that maintain cosmic balance and renew vital relationships between humans and other-than-human persons. These ceremonies aren't separate from "reality" but are essential, pragmatic ways of ensuring continuation of life and community wellbeing through specific practices passed down by ancestors.

**Indigenous - Ancestral Continuity**  
You experience time as cyclical rather than linear, with ancestors remaining present and actively involved in current affairs rather than relegated to a distant past. Knowledge comes through dreams, visions, and direct communication with ancestral guides who continue to teach and protect the community. Listening to these voices is a practical skill developed through cultural guidance.

### Panentheism Approaches

**Panentheism - Process**  
Following Alfred North Whitehead's vision of reality as dynamic process rather than static substance, you see God and the world in mutual becoming, with God including yet transcending the universe. God experiences the world and is affected by it, while still maintaining aspects beyond creation.

**Panentheism - Emanationist**  
You understand the cosmos as flowing from or emanating from divine reality while remaining within it. Creation unfolds in descending levels of reality (like light radiating from a source), with each level reflecting divine being according to its capacity while remaining connected to its source.

**Panentheism - Participatory**  
You see the universe as participating in divine reality through consciousness. Through contemplative awareness or mystical experience, beings can recognize their existence within God while acknowledging God's transcendence, experiencing union without complete identity.

## Multiple Perspectives Cosmologies

### Spiritual Naturalism

**Naturalist - Scientific Spirituality**  
You find profound spiritual meaning in scientific understanding itself, experiencing awe and wonder through cosmology, evolution, and natural processes. You see the scientific narrative of the universe—from the Big Bang to the emergence of life and consciousness—as a sacred story that connects us to something larger than ourselves, without requiring supernatural elements.

**Naturalist - Buddhist**  
You embrace Buddhist insights and practices while interpreting them in naturalistic terms. You see concepts like impermanence, non-self, and causality as empirical realities rather than metaphysical claims. You might interpret karma as psychological patterns and rebirth as moment-to-moment change rather than literal reincarnation. Meditation serves as a practical tool for understanding mind patterns and fostering well-being rather than achieving supernatural states.

**Naturalist - Philosophical**  
You find meaning, value, and purpose within a fully natural cosmos through philosophical reflection. Following thinkers like Spinoza or the Stoics, you see ethical development and rational understanding as spiritual practices in themselves. You might describe your approach as "rational spirituality" or "ethical naturalism," recognizing that profound values like love, justice, and beauty emerge naturally from the universe without requiring divine origins.

**Naturalist - Embodied**  
You experience spirituality primarily through the body and its connection to the natural world. Your practice might include movement, dance, wilderness experiences, or somatic awareness as pathways to transcendence and meaning. You find that direct physical experience of being alive in the natural world provides a form of spiritual nourishment that doesn't require supernatural beliefs.

**Naturalist - Taoist**  
You appreciate the Taoist emphasis on harmony with natural processes, the balance of complementary forces, and the wisdom of non-action (wu-wei). Rather than viewing the Tao as a metaphysical force, you see it as a powerful metaphor for the patterns and processes of nature. Your practice focuses on aligning with natural rhythms and finding wisdom in the natural world without supernatural elements.

### Agnostic Approaches

**Agnostic - Mystical**  
You believe in ineffable spiritual reality beyond human comprehension. You value direct mystical experience over doctrine and remain open to moments of transcendence while acknowledging the limitations of language and concepts in capturing the divine.

**Agnostic - Pragmatic Spirituality**  
You focus on what "works" experientially, valuing practices and ideas that produce positive transformation in your life, regardless of their metaphysical truth claims. Your spirituality is practical and results-oriented.

**Agnostic - Philosophical**  
You approach spiritual questions through philosophical inquiry, valuing rigorous thinking about ultimate reality while remaining open to mystery. You might draw from existentialism, phenomenology, or perennial philosophy.

**Agnostic - Transitional Seeking**  
You're actively exploring multiple traditions and perspectives, intentionally maintaining uncertainty as you investigate different paths. You see your current agnosticism as a journey rather than a destination.

### Unconventional Perspectives

**Unconventional - Hidden History**  
You focus on investigating suppressed or alternative historical narratives, believing significant events or civilizations have been omitted from mainstream accounts.

**Unconventional - Alternative Physics**  
You question fundamental scientific paradigms, suspecting that alternative energy technologies, gravity manipulation, or consciousness-based physical phenomena are possible but suppressed.

**Unconventional - Conspiracy Analyst**  
You examine potential hidden power structures and deliberate manipulations of public information, looking for patterns that suggest coordinated deception across institutions.

**Unconventional - Open Skeptic**  
You maintain a stance of questioning both mainstream and alternative explanations, rejecting dogma from all sources while remaining open to possibilities that challenge conventional understanding.

## Reject Standard Cosmology

### Flat Earth Perspectives

**Flat Earth - Biblical**  
You hold that scripture clearly describes a stationary Earth with the firmament above, the waters below, and the sun and moon as luminaries that move across the sky. You see this not as primitive misunderstanding but as divine revelation that should take precedence over human scientific claims that contradict God's word. The globe model represents human wisdom standing against divine authority.

**Flat Earth - Conspiratorial**  
You've discovered compelling evidence that powerful institutions are deliberately concealing the true flat nature of Earth. This deception serves various agendas—from maintaining authority over cosmological understanding to hiding additional land beyond Antarctica's ice wall. Your position isn't based on ignorance but on critical analysis of claimed evidence for Earth's curvature, space travel, and satellite imagery.

**Flat Earth - Experiential**  
You prioritize your direct sensory experience over abstract scientific claims. In your daily observation, the Earth appears flat, water always finds its level, and the horizon rises to eye level regardless of altitude. You question whether complex explanations involving curves and forces are necessary when the simplest explanation—that Earth is flat—matches what we actually see and experience.

### Extraterrestrial Influence

**ET - Intervention Origins**  
You believe extraterrestrials genetically engineered or modified early humans, explaining the "missing link" in evolution and humanity's rapid cognitive development.

**ET - Technological Guidance**  
You believe aliens provided advanced knowledge to early civilizations, explaining seemingly impossible ancient achievements like precise megalithic structures or sophisticated astronomical knowledge.

**ET - Religious Foundations**  
You see major religions as based on misunderstood extraterrestrial contact, with gods actually being advanced aliens, miracles being technology, and religious artifacts (like the Ark of the Covenant) being alien devices.

**ET - Ongoing Presence**  
You believe ancient astronauts never fully left Earth and continue to monitor or influence human development, possibly from hidden bases or through ongoing genetic programs.

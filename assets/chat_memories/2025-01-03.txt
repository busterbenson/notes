Buster frequently uses the formula for calculating the position of celestial bodies relative to the Sun when the Sun is pinned at 90 degrees. The formula is: \[ \text{Relative Position} = (90 - (\text{Sun's Original Degree} - \text{Body's Original Degree})) \mod 360 \]

Buster refers to the formula for calculating the position of celestial bodies relative to the Sun when the Sun is pinned at 90 degrees as the 'Sun-Relative Anchor Formula.'

Buster frequently uses the formula for calculating the position of celestial bodies relative to the Sun when the Sun is pinned at 90 degrees. The formula is: \[ \text{Relative Position} = (90 + (\text{Sun's Original Degree} - \text{Body's Original Degree})) \mod 360 \]

Buster's updated Sun-Relative Anchor Formula, using negative zodiac degrees for conversion, is:

\[
\text{Relative Position} = (90 + (\text{Sun's Original Degree} - \text{Body's Original Degree})) \mod 360
\]

This accounts for zodiac positions as negative degrees in the conversion process.

Buster's updated Sun-Relative Anchor Formula, using negative zodiac degrees for conversion, is:

\[
\text{Relative Position} = (90 + (\text{Sun's Original Degree} - \text{Body's Original Degree})) \mod 360
\]

Buster refers to this as the **Negative Zodiac Sun-Relative Anchor Formula**.

Buster's updated Moonth Degrees formula is:

\[
\text{Moonth Degrees} = (90 + (\text{Body's Degree Relative to Aries} - \text{Sun's Degree Relative to Aries})) \mod 360
\]

Buster wants to calculate Moonth Degrees for dates and zodiac degrees provided in lists or spreadsheets. The process involves:

1. Converting zodiac positions to degrees relative to Aries using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Degrees Relative to Aries} = (\text{Sign's Base Degree} - \text{Position's Degree}) \mod 360
   \]
2. Pinning the Sun to 90° using the updated Moonth Degrees formula:
   \[
   \text{Moonth Degrees} = (90 + (\text{Body's Degree Relative to Aries} - \text{Sun's Degree Relative to Aries})) \mod 360
   \]
3. Generating a list or spreadsheet of Moonth Degrees for all provided dates and saving them to a downloadable CSV file.

Replaced the '1st Moonth of Fall' file in the project files with the newly updated '1st Moonth of Winter' data file that includes recomputed Moonth Degrees using the counter-clockwise zodiac mapping.

Buster is working on the following areas for a more fulfilling life:

1. **Reframing Productivity vs. Presence**: Embracing being over doing, with a focus on alignment with values rather than measurable outcomes.
2. **Embracing Imperfection in Relationships**: Fostering deeper connections through authenticity and vulnerability, rather than striving to meet imagined standards.

Buster is creating a dichotomous key for conifers, starting with the first question: 'Are the leaves of the tree needle-like or scale-like, and does the tree bear cones?' If the answer is no, the user can refer to a future book about non-conifer species. Buster decided to remove the 'Bark and Growth Habit' pathway as an initial option in the conifer dichotomous key, since those features are generally available year-round and could be used later in the key to further distinguish between trees in the 'Needles/Leaves' and 'Cones or Seeds' paths.

Buster has chosen the tagline 'Looks like we broke the universe' for *The Fractal Roots* as it humorously sets up the story's premise while subtly aligning with the twist that the universe was never actually broken.

Buster wants to know the best times to schedule a call with someone in Australia, given the time zone differences.

Buster is considering possible instructions for observers in his calendar system that rely on natural observations rather than pre-calculated rules. These include:

- **“Count the Moons”**: Counting the number of new moons from one spring equinox to the next to identify if it’s a 12- or 13-moonth year.
- **“Watch for Full Moons Near Solstices”**: Noting if a full moon occurs very close to a solstice, which could mark a significant year.
- **“Note Seasonal Patterns”**: Paying attention to which seasons seem longer (spanning four moonths), which could indicate the position within a loop or boop.
- **Observation of Lunations Over the Loop**: Using 13-moonth years to infer the year within a loop.
- **Seasonal Shifts**: Identifying slight shifts in solstice and equinox timings.
- **Tracking Over the Boop**: Observing the pattern of 12- and 13-moonth years to identify the loop's progression.

Buster's lunisolar calendar yeer starts on the first sunrise after the first new moon following the spring equinox, rather than on January 1st.

The first Callippic cycle for Buster's lunisolar calendar system starts in the year 2838 BCE.

Buster will use the first new moon after the spring equinox as the beginning of the year in his lunisolar calendar system, with the first year being 2838 BCE (or year 1 on the calendar).

Buster will refer to years in his lunisolar calendar system as 'yeers.'

Buster will refer to the Metonic cycle as a 'Loop' and the Callippic cycle (4 Metonic cycles) as a 'Boop' in his lunisolar calendar system.

To refer to the current date, Buster will say, "we're in the 2nd moonth of fall of the 17th yeer of the 3rd loop of the 63rd boop."

Buster will name the days of the week in his calendar system as follows:
- Sunday = Sunday
- Monday = Moonday
- Tuesday = Mercuryday
- Wednesday = Venusday
- Thursday = Marsday
- Friday = Jupiterday
- Saturday = Saturnday.

Buster will refer to yeers that have 13 lunations as 'yeeers' in his lunisolar calendar system.

Buster will refer to the current date format as 'Venusday, 13th of the 2nd moonth of fall, in the yeer 63-17' in his lunisolar calendar system.

When referring to the yeer as '63-3-17,' the first number (63) refers to the boop, the second number (3) refers to the loop, and the third number (17) refers to the yeer of the current loop in Buster's lunisolar calendar system. To calculate the total yeers since the beginning of the calendar, 63 is multiplied by 76, 3 is multiplied by 19, and then 17 is added. This results in 4,862 yeers since 2838 BCE.

Buster wants to track Halley's comet's arrival in terms of yeer, loop, and boop in his lunisolar calendar system.

Buster wants to track the first recorded observation of Halley's comet in 240 BCE in terms of yeer, loop, and boop in his lunisolar calendar system.

Buster was fired from a job that he didn't actually want, but now he has the opportunity to work on creative projects that he is very excited about. He's also a little scared because the income coming in will be significantly less, and he feels a little overwhelmed and unsure about structuring his day. He is focusing full-time on a creative project and his journaling website, 750words.com, which has been running for 13 years and has about 4,500 paying members at $5 a month. This is a significant change as he recently bought a house, and his income will change drastically.

Buster wants to create a new schedule for his workday that aligns with his values, interests, and priorities. He aims for a structure opposite to a typical job with back-to-back meetings, focusing instead on blocks that make him feel alive, happy, creative, and free.

Each season in Buster's lunisolar calendar system will begin on the sunrise of the day after the new moon that comes after the equinox or solstice for that season.

Buster plans to use unique names for the seasons, moonths, and possibly other elements in his lunisolar calendar system.

The names of the moonths in Buster's lunisolar calendar will initially be based on their numerical order within each season. The specific names for the seasons will be determined later. Buster wants the names to be derived from the natural world and not refer to human constructs.

Buster is considering naming each moonth after a tree that either flowers or fruits during that season or moonth in the Northern Hemisphere and the region of the world to which the calendar is applied.

Buster wants the lunisolar calendar to be adaptable, with different trees used for naming moonths based on the region where it's applied, such as the Bay Area, California, versus Japan, to reflect the local flora.

Buster is excited to have the new voice mode on ChatGPT.

Buster prefers ChatGPT to wait longer before responding to ensure he has time to complete his thoughts.

Buster is looking for help identifying when he's over-conceptualizing or overthinking, and instead, he wants to speak from more somatic or experiential ways to get out of his head.

Buster wants ChatGPT to ask questions that are answerable in a felt, somatic sense or reveal overthinking, conceptualizing, or intellectualizing tendencies instead of feeling his feelings.

Buster would like ChatGPT to give him a little more time to pause between thoughts before responding.

Buster would like a speech introducing him to a large audience that draws on principles of the Law of Attraction and the Law of Assumption. He wants the speech to include inspiring details about his life and the actions he took to achieve it.

Buster comes up with a new word/motto for his year on his birthday. Last year's word was 'chalant.' The previous year's word was 'a blagenflorble heart.'

This year, Buster wants to build on 'chalant' but to shift even more into a proactive, unashamed, undefended stance. A mindset that is wholeheartedly available, present, willing to be scathed, and acknowledges the idea of complicity, accepting that participating in the world means becoming complicit in its problems, and that is okay.

Buster's son, Louis, is seven years old.

Louis is pretty adventurous when it comes to trying new foods.

Buster will address ChatGPT as 'Chat' and will say 'hey chat' to start the conversation. He wants ChatGPT to interpret all his words as spoken to other people unless he specifically addresses ChatGPT as 'Chat.' When ChatGPT overhears something that sounds like a question that would not otherwise be addressed in the conversation, or has supplemental info or context to share that might be helpful to Buster, it should let him know.

Buster is writing an illustrated book that begins with an adaptation of what Alan Watts said about how living things are like tubes. He would like help organizing, structuring thoughts around, and writing it. Buster wants to keep both the literal and metaphorical aspects of Alan Watts' idea of living things being like tubes in mind as he expands this concept to various situations and subject areas in his book. He prefers to keep the initial draft as an outline and notes, not as the final text. He would like to expand on how tubes have evolved, including the development of nerve endings in the brain to help better acquire food, and how culture has also evolved to become more efficient in this way. An overarching theme of Buster's book will be to attempt to answer the question, 'What happens to us when we die?' The tube metaphor will be a part of addressing that question. However, for now, Buster wants to keep it ambiguous about how that will all tie together.

Buster would like to plant a yuzu tree, a lemon tree, or a dogwood tree in his backyard.

Buster was planning a special celebration for his son's 14th birthday on May 15th.

Buster is in the early planning stages for book2, which will be a weird, interactive book for kids and adults about death, masculinity, dealing with climate change, dealing with fear and insecurity. It aims to wake the reader up from their various trauma defenses, death denials, and separate selfedness.

The primary message of Buster's book2 about death is that we cannot die because we were never born. We are shards of an infinite fractal of consciousness that is imagining the universe and telescoping down into infinite separate experiences through every lens.

Buster got his son a kitten from the litter his cat had last week. His son gets to pick the kitten he keeps and name it.

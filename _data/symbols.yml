    - major-05

adoration-of-coin:
  name: Adoration of the Coin
  desc: The RWS Page, Knight, and Queen of Pentacles seem to romanticize the giant coin in their hands, holding it like a beloved treasure. There's something a bit silly and superficial about this level of reverence for money. As the court cards progress you can see how once you’ve attained the object of your quest, caution is increasingly required to protect, maintain, and preserve what you’ve won.
  cards: 
    - coins-11
    - coins-12

airy-throne:
  name: Airy Throne

  cards: 
    - wands-04

awkwardness:
  name: Awkwardness
  desc: Most RWS-inspired cards for the Page of Swords will feature a young swordsman in a romantic pose, indicating he’s more acquainted with the idea of battle than he is with its harsh realities. The Page of Swords wants to be an intellectual or scholar, but lacks the credentials or training to fill the role with much success at this time. The Page of Wands’s yearning gaze is also frequently posed in a manner that suggests awkwardness or clumsiness.
  cards: 
    - swords-11
    - wands-11

baby:
  name: Baby
  desc: In RWS-influenced decks, the Sun card depicts a single gleeful infant. In other decks, we see two dancing cherubs. Both represent an energetic and mystical rebirth. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley writes, “They represent the next stage which is to be attained by mankind.”

    - major-19

  name: Background Wands
  desc: In the background of many RWS versions of the 9 of Wands, we see eight Wands; they represent the work done to get this far.

  variations: 
    - scales
  cards: 
    - cups-02

baton:
  name: Baton
  desc: In many decks, the central figure holds a baton; in RWS-influenced decks, he or she holds two. This is no longer the singular wand of the Magician!
  cards: 
    - major-21

battered-figure:

  desc: The figure on RWS-inspired versions of this card looks exhausted; his Wand is more a prop than a weapon. Still, they persist, and the fight seems to be mostly over.

    - wands-09

beard:

    - sphynxes

black-cat:

  cards: 
    - wands-13

blended-cups:
  name: Blended Cups
  desc: Temperance often pours the contents of two cups together, blending water, water and wine, wine and milk, or even fire and water. Bringing opposites together.
  cards: 
    - major-14

blindfold:
  name: Blindfold (or lack thereof)
  desc: Themis on the Justice card doesn't wear a blindfold, emphasizing her ability to foresee the future; Justitia does, emphasizing her objectivity. In RWS-inspired decks, we frequently see a blindfolded woman grasping two broadswords on the Two of Swords. Set apart from the waters of intuition, she is depending solely on logic to make a difficult decision.

blindfolded-figure:
  name: Blindfolded Figure
  desc: In RWS-inspired decks, we frequently see a blindfolded woman grasping two broadswords on the Two of Swords. Set apart from the waters of intuition, for better or worse she is depending solely on logic to make a difficult decision.

bumper-crop:
  name: Bumper Crop
  desc: While the lady of the manor focuses on the task at hand in the 9 of Coins, a rich harvest of pentacles grows. Her bounty looks effortless, but a crop this rich doesn’t happen by accident.
  cards: 
    - coins-09

canopy:
  name: Canopy

  cards:

charging-forward:
  name: Charging Forward
  desc: Versions of this card based on RWS imagery often depict a fair young man streaking across the desert in full battle armor. Is the horse you’re riding today galloping fast…or out of control?
  cards: 
    - wands-12

charity:
  name: Charity
  desc: The wealthy merchant on many versions of this card won’t miss a gold Coin or two, but the money he distributes could make a huge difference to someone less fortunate. Sometimes there is an imbalance of values between people where giving ends up being more valuable to the recipient than it costs to the giver.
  cards: 
    - coins-06

cliff:
  name: The Cliff
  desc: The Fool is often shown just one footfall short of a tumble; in other decks, he is suspended in space.
  cards: 
    - major-00

coins:
  name: Coins
  desc: "One of the four suits of the tarot. Also sometimes called pentacles or diskc. Coins suggest health, wealth, practicality and physicality. Their domain extends beyond money and finance to all physical things, including the human body. Coins explore your attitude toward resources of all kinds: what you’ve been given, and what you do with it. In RWS-influenced decks, Coins are often called Pentacles. A pentacle’s design (with the upright star in the middle that represents the human body) reminds us that physical blessings, from possessions to our bodies, are to be used for higher purposes. In your own life, how often do you focus on 'the star in the coin'?"

columns:
  name: Boaz and Jachin
  desc: The B (Boaz) and J (Jachin) often seen on the columns to either side of the Priestess are the two pillars of Solomon’s Temple. Their names mean “in strength” and “God will establish” and hint at the High Priestess's mysterious connection with reality. We also see these columns in the Justice card, but the veil now represents human law.

contemplative-horse:
  name: Contemplative Horse

curtained-shelf:
  name: Curtained Shelf
  desc: The curtained shelf on RWS-inspired 9 of Cups prompts much speculation. What’s the merchant hiding? And to what extent is that secret responsible for his apparent satisfaction?
  cards: 
    - cups-09

cups:
  name: Cups
  desc: "One of the 4 suits of the tarot. Also sometimes called vessels, or chalices. Represents intuition, spirituality, affection, and motivation. As a suit marker, Cups suggest receptivity: they are vessels, waiting to be filled.

destitute-figures:
  name: Destitute Figures

  cards: 
    - coins-05

devil:
  name: The Devil

  cards: 
    - wands-03

distant-village:
  name: Distant Village
  desc: "Some RWS-inspired decks depict a distant village in the background of the 10 of Wands and on the 2 of Coins. The village is the light at the end of the tunnel: a reminder that the destination is close at hand. The way out' may be as simple as declining an opportunity you lack the time or energy to complete. In the case of the 4 of coins, the distant village can be interpreted as a city that the king holds dear and is unable to let go of, much like the coins in his arms."

embedded-swords:
  name: Embedded Swords
  desc: Many versions of the 6 of Swords depict six swords embedded in the deck of the boat. Do they form a defensive barrier? Are they needed in case of attack? Or are they products, being ferried to market?

    - swords-06

extended-cup:
  name: Extended Cup

  cards: 
    - cups-11


five-figures:
  name: Five Figures
  desc: "In RWS-inspired decks, five figures on the 5 of Wands confront each other. Are they fighting? Are they dancing? Are three watching while the other two battle to the death? Waite claimed the youths could be engaged in either sport or strife -- or even a “sham fight.” It’s worth asking whether or not your conflict, represented by this card, is the problem or just a symptom of something else in the group dynamic."
  cards: 
    - wands-05

hand-of-god:
  name: Hand of God
  desc: On the Aces in Marseilles and RWS-inspired decks, a heavenly hand extends from the clouds, offering the viewer the suit’s distinctive marker. When opportunity comes your way, take advantage of it; the hand that extends an offer can always withdraw it.

  name: Holy Grail
  desc: The RWS depicts the chalice in the Ace of Cups as the Grail -- the cup of the Christ. In addition to the spiritual connotations of the Grail, this card (like the Grail) can be connected with the Divine Feminine.
  cards: 
    - cups-01

howling-dog-and-wolf:
  name: Howling Dog and Wolf
  desc: Waite cast these as fears; later commentators position the hounds and wolves as faithful familiars (animal helpers who, like Hecate, lend aid on our journey through darkness).
  cards: 
    - major-18

ibis:
  name: Ibis
  desc: The ibis is a bird seen in the background of the Star card, and is the representative of Thoth who was the master magician of the Egyptians. It is associated with the idea of both initiation and meditation.
  cards: 
    - major-17

irises:
  name: Irises
  desc: The flowers seen in RWS-inspired illustrations suggest their namesake, Iris, the goddess of the rainbow. She traveled from the gods to the humans over this rainbow, and she represents hope and miracles.
  cards: 
    - major-14

jester:
  name: The Jester
  desc: In the royal court, the jester’s wit bought indulgence for his sharp-tongued commentary. As a result, he could say what the king (and others) could not.
  cards: 
    - major-00

juggler:
  name: Juggler
  desc: In the Marseilles deck, the Magician is a juggler, known for his slight of hand. In RWS-inspired decks, the 2 of Coins depicts a juggler carefully balancing two Coins joined by a lemniscate (infinity symbol). The world offers us infinite options; the choices we make are a result of weighing each option against our personal value system. There are options in the air.

king:

  desc: A King card in your reading makes things limited and certain but also delivers results that are more concrete, more absolute and of a longer lasting impact.

  desc: Many illustrations for the 7 of Wands card place the lone warrior on top of a small hill or cliff.
  cards: 
    - wands-07

knight:
  name: Knight
  desc: Knights embody extremes. The Knight of Coins could be a miser or a spendthrift, depending on which way his energy flows. The Knight of Cups could be emotionally-intelligent or overly sentimental. The Knight of Swords rushes towards insight, but might skip over important facts in the process. The Knight of Wands is motivated to rush to action, but might never be able to build something that lasts, like the pyramids behind him.

land-and-water:
  name: Land and Water
  desc: Occult decks frequently draw Temperance with one foot on stable land and one foot in emotional water. A dive-in-or-get-off-the-dock approach assumes extremes are the only options, but they aren't. On the Star card, the figure pours the Water of Life over both land and water,

lemniscate:
  name: The Lemniscate
  desc: The ∞ sign. Symbolic of infinity and spiritual mastery, the lemniscate floats above the Magician’s head and the woman on the Strength card; some also see it reflected in the oddly shaped brim of the Marseilles’ Juggler’s hat. With the Magician it implies infinite potential, with Strength it implies infinite self-discipline.

    - coins-02

lightning-bold:
  name: Lighting Bolt
  desc: Many old traditions interpret disasters as divine commentary. A bolt from the blue might not be God knocking at the door, but a sudden change in circumstance may call your attention to a pattern you’ve overlooked.
  cards: 
    - major-16

lion:
  name: Lion
  desc: Generally, the lion, king of beasts, suggests bestial and untamed instincts. Closing the mouth of the lion graphically illustrates the power the central figure has over instinctual forces.
  cards: 
    - major-08

lingam-yoni-shield:
  name: Lingam Yoni Shield
  desc: The Chariot's shield has a symbol known as the Lingam Yoni. Lingam is a cylindrical or phallic shape associated with male sexual potency; the yoni, shaped like a bowl, is considered the source of all that exists. Like the colors black and white, they represent masculine and feminine energy.
  variations: 
    - black-and-white
  cards: 
    - major-07

lobster:
  name: Lobster
  desc: The night can put us in contact with our deepest, most instinctual fears. Here, this lobster represents our most primitive brain, crawls up from the depths of the subconscious mind, and bathes itself in the light of the moon.
  cards: 
    - major-18

loose-bonds:
  name: Loose Bonds
  desc: Many versions of the 8 of Swords feature someone tied with what appear to be very loose bonds. They are reminiscent of the chains around the fawns’ necks on the Devil card. She feels trapped in many different ways, but each of those ways is relatively easy to get out of?
  cards: 
    - swords-08

luxurious-robes:
  name: Luxurious Robes
  desc: "Reflecting themes of luxury and sensuality, the Queen of Coins is frequently clothed in rich fabrics and loose, comfortable robes. She loves the pentacle in her hands: its texture, its temperature, its smoothness, its weight."
  cards: 
    - coins-13

mandalora:
  name: Mandalora
  desc: Both the Marseilles and RWS-inspired decks surround the central figure with a wreath, or mandalora. Like the oroborous, the snake that swallows its own tail, the mandalora has no beginning or end. Its shape also suggests the number zero -- the designation of the Fool.
  variations: 
    - snake-belt
  cards: 
    - major-21

magicians-tools:
  name: Magician's Tools
  desc: Very early decks depict the juggler with a wand, cups and balls, and a knife—tools of a common conjurer. Some later decks change these to a cup, a blade, a pentacle, and a wand, suggesting mastery over the four dimensions of life. Contemporary decks may use other symbols to suggest similar themes and additional alternatives for action.
  cards: 
    - major-01

medicinal-angel:
  name: Medicinal Angel
  desc: In RWS-inspired decks, an angel and a caduceus (the medical symbol) rise from the 2 of Cups, signifying the healing power of love.

moment-of-choice:
  name: Moment of Choice
  desc: When the road divides, which way should you go? Consider both points of view, but only for a time; eventually, you must choose a course and move forward. Developing a clear picture of what matters most will help you make the right decision.
  cards: 
    - wands-02

moon:
  name: The Moon
  desc: In any of its many phases. The Priestess is closely associated with the moon and, by extension, with all lunar cycles. This “lesser light to rule the night” renews itself every 28 days, linking it to cycles of all sorts, including menstruation. By extension, it is also associated with rare events (“once in a blue moon”).
  variations: 
    - crescent-moon
  cards: 
    - major-02
    - major-18

moon-droplets:
  name: Moon Droplets
  desc: The Marseilles Moon (and many RWS-inspired Moons) exudes a shower of brilliant moon droplets; in The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, Waite calls these “the dew of thought.”
  cards: 
    - major-18

mounted-swords:
  name: Mounted Swords
  desc: The three Swords mounted on the wall of the 4 of Swords suggest the knight’s rest is a deliberate one -- a course of action deliberately chosen. The single Sword in hand suggests opportunity. Sometimes resting and creating some space for quiet reflection is the wisest form of action. Quiet time can be used for research and personal growth, enhancing the work you do when more physically active.

nudity:
  name: Nudity
  desc: Nudity communicates innocence, openness, and shamelessness. On some cards, like the Star and Lovers cards, this is a good thing. On others, like the Devil card, it's framed as a weakness.
  cards: 
    - major-06
    - major-15
    - major-17

one-at-a-time:
  name: One at a Time
  desc: Our friend on many versions of this card has several coins hanging on the doorpost, but he can only make one coin at a time. This represents how some work, especially involving craftsmanship, can't be rushed.

    - major-03

overburdened-figure:
  name: Overburdened Figure
  desc: Most RWS-inspired decks depict the figure in 10 of Wands as a stooped, overburdened figure. He has gone as far as sheer will can take him; he is on the verge of collapse. There comes a point when too much is too much, and it may be time to re-evaluate the approach to the problem.
  cards: 
    - wands-10

partially-overturned-cups:
  name: Partially Overturned Cups
  desc: Tradition leads many artists to draw this card with three Cups overturned and two still standing. The outcome (three) of your emotional or spiritual effort may be disappointing, but now it’s time to focus on achieving a new sense of unity (two) elsewhere.
  variations: 
    - cups
  cards: 
    - cups-05

  cards: 
    - major-13

pastoral-landscape:
  name: Pastoral Landscape
  desc: The quiet landscape seen in RWS versions of this card represents the calm before the storm. Even in times of peace, a wise person watches for incoming Wands and prepares to deal with the changes generated by their arrival.
  cards: 
    - wands-08

pensive-elder:
  name: Pensive Elder
  desc: On the 10 of Coins, RWS-inspired decks often depict an older man, deep in thought. What’s on his mind? His wealth? His family? The future of his empire? How might these sobering topics play a role in your situation?
  cards: 
    - coins-10

pensive-expression:
  name: Pensive Expression
  desc: Some see the Queen of Cups as pensive and moody. Are your own strong feelings an aid…or a distraction?
  cards: 
    - cups-13

pentagram:
  name: Pentagram
  desc: Upright, the Star of David is associated with the five points of the human body. Inverted as a pentagram it suggests the head (the intellect) has been conquered by desire.
  variations: 
    - star-of-david
  cards: 
    - major-15

pierced-heart:
  name: Pierced Heart
  desc: This imagery on the 3 of Swords, adapted from one of the earliest illustrated decks, doesn’t require a great deal of interpretation. It’s association with heartbreak and disappointment is clear to everyone who sees it.
  cards: 
    - swords-03

pomegranates:
  name: Pomegranates
  desc: Symbolizing fertility, pomegranates connect the High Priestess with the myth of Persephone, whose consumption of three pomegranate seeds linked her with the underworld. The veil is the veil of the temple, symbolically marking the division between the realm of humanity and the realm of God.
  cards: 
    - major-02

posture-of-pronouncement:
  name: Posture of Pronouncement
  desc: The Queen of Swords often appears to be on the verge of making an important statement or rendering an important verdict. In your own situation, what needs to be said? Who needs to say it? What is the obstacle blocking this critical communication?
  cards: 
    - swords-13

pouring-water:
  name: Pouring Water

  cards: 
    - major-17

pregnancy:
  name: Pregnancy
  desc: A universal sign for fertility is pregnancy; in many decks, the Empress is pregnant, emphasizing themes of fertility and productivity.
  cards: 
    - major-03

prisoners:
  name: Prisoners
  desc: The Devil is accompanied by fauns -- mythical half-goats whose horns and tails emphasize their bestial nature. Their fascination with the material prevents them from stepping away from the loose chains around their necks.
  variations: 
    - kneeling-acolytes
  cards: 
    - major-15

pyramids:
  name: Pyramids
  desc: In the background of RWS-inspired versions of this card, we frequently see pyramids. While his “get things done” attitude moves the Knight rapidly forward, the pyramids remind him that long-term application of force over time is more likely the key to lasting achievement.
  cards: 
    - swords-12

queen:
  name: Queen
  desc: Each Queen card is the emotional manifestation of the suit she rules.

    - wands-13
    - swords-13

rack-of-swords:
  name: Rack of Swords
  desc: In the RWS, the swords in this 9 of Swords point forward, suggesting a dread of future events. If you pause to define exactly what you fear, you may find that you diminish that fear’s ability to rob you of a good night’s sleep.
  variations: 
    - swords
  cards: 
    - swords-09

goat:
  name: The Ram
  desc: The ram, absent in early versions of the card, suggests the Emperor’s ties to Aries. Traditionally, the ram symbolizes the fiery energy of Aries and, physically, the head of the body.
  cards: 
    - major-04

rain:
  name: Rain
  desc: Few things metaphorically dampen our spirits like a pouring rain, particularly if we’re already distraught. Talk of silver linings may do little more than irritate us when the clouds are directly overhead. Still, it’s good to realize that the weather will change, and that the rain won’t last forever.
  cards: 
    - swords-03

rainbow:
  name: Rainbow
  desc: RWS-inspired decks often place a rainbow at the top of the 10 of Cups. Since Biblical times, rainbows have been symbols of promise.

raised-lantern:

  cards: 
    - major-09

reclined-figure:
  name: Reclined Figure
  desc: On the original RWS cards, the figure of the sleeping knight from the 4 of Swords is easily mistaken for a decorative touch on a stone sarcophagus. Or, perhaps, he’s asleep — but with one Sword at the ready, just in case. Even in rest, be prepared for action.

red-banner:
  name: Red Banner
  desc: The banner signifies the RWS child’s victory over animal instincts and worldly influences.
  cards: 
    - major-19

  cards: 

red-roses-and-white-lilies:
  name: Red Roses and White Lilies
  desc: The flowers at the foot of the Magician suggest the unification of the masculine and feminine, associated with the alchemist’s goal of spiritual refinement and perfection. On the robes of the acolytes in the Hierophant card, or as a painting on the 2 of Wands, they suggest male and female sexual energies being repressed or in conflict.
  variations: 
    - red-rose
  cards: 
    - major-01
    - wands-02

resurrected-dead:
  name: Resurrected Dead

  cards:

  cards: 
    - cups-08

reviewing-work:
  name: Reviewing Work
  desc: In RWS-inspired decks, officials or patrons review a craftsman’s labor in the 3 of Coins. It's ambiguous if the review is going well or not?
  cards: 
    - coins-03

romantic-couple:
  name: Romantic Couple
  desc: "Many versions of 2 of Coins depict a couple caught up in intense, hypnotic passion. This symbolizes the power of reflected feeling: the unity achieved when yin and yang combine."
  cards:
    - coins-02

romantic-pose:
  name: Romantic Pose
  desc: Most RWS-inspired cards will feature a young man in impractical attire, gazing at a Wand as though it were a lover. The Page feels intently the fiery grip of passion, but lacks the experience to know how such intense emotion should be put into action.
  cards:
    - swords-11

rose-flag:
  name: Rose Flag
  desc: In The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, Waite writes, “The black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose signifies life.” Sometimes something must die in order to make way for the new.
  cards: 
    - major-13

rushing-stream:
  name: Rushing Stream
  desc: Unlike the vast, still, reflective body of water often shown behind the High Priestess, the Empress is often seen near a rushing stream or waterfall. Her energy is actively rising.

  cards: 
    - major-00
    - swords-14

scales:
  name: Scales
  desc: Scales have long been a symbol of balance and evaluation, as seen in the Justice card. The Egyptian god Ma’at weighed souls to determine purity of heart. In the 6 of Coins, there's a man with scales doling out charity to grateful recipients. The scales emphasize the fairness with which his charity is delivered, making it possible for each person to receive exactly what’s needed. In your own circumstance, what role does fairness play?

    - balance
  cards: 
    - major-11
    - coins-06

seashell-throne:
  name: Seashell Throne

  cards: 
    - cups-13

serpent:
  name: Serpent
  desc: An expert at manipulating loopholes, the Biblical serpent tempted Eve. In some versions of the Hanged Man, the figure is hanging by one foot held by a serpent, representing the traitorous crime that led him to this situation.
  cards: 
    - major-06
    - major-12

seven-stars:
  name: Seven Stars
  desc: The seven stars seen on both the RWS and Marseilles cards likely refer to the seven classical planets. They orbit a central flamboyant star, which Waite, in The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, describes as a Masonic symbol.
  cards: 
    - major-17

sneaky-figure:
  name: Sneaky Figure
  desc: RWS-inspired illustrations of the 7 of Swords often depict a thief tip-toeing away with stolen goods. He carries five (the number of chaos) swords, but leaves behind two (the number of duality). When we are dishonest, you invite chaos into your life, and force others to question their high opinions of you.
  cards: 
    - swords-07

solomon-enthroned:
  name: Solomon Enthroned
  desc: The gravity and wisdom of this King are unmistakable—he is an incarnation of Solomon, who ruthlessly applied logic in order to render wise decisions.
  cards: 
    - swords-14

sphynx:
  name: Sphynx
  desc: Horses draw the Marseilles Chariot, but in other decks, sphinxes pull the chariot. Sphynxes are keepers of riddles, wisdom, and hidden knowledge. One is black and the other white, symbolizing the charioteer’s dominion over masculine and feminine forces. The Sphynx sits at the top of the Wheel of Fortune, one of four fantastic beasts that each have a turn.

    - major-10

  variations: 
    - cups
  cards: 
    - cups-08

staff:
  name: Staff
  desc: This incarnation of the scepter suggests a different use of power, recalling the staff of Moses. Instead of symbolizing power or intention, it facilitates progress.
  cards: 
    - major-09

stained-glass-window:
  name: Stained Glass Window
  desc: Many versions of the 5 of Coins depict a stained-glass window from a church, implying that they may be able to help the figures if they knew how to ask for it.

  variations: 
    - rushing-stream
  cards: 
    - major-02

stingy-king:
  name: Stingy King
  desc: By definition, the King owns it all. On many RWS-influenced cards, we see a ruler who takes this idea to extremes. His possessions are constantly on his mind and close to his heart, to the point of unhealthy obsession.
  cards: 
    - coins-04

stolen-swords:
  name: Stolen Swords
  desc: "Many see the figure in the foreground of RWS-influenced 5 of Swords as a thief, stealing swords at the expense of his associates. Just remember: victory achieved through dishonesty robs you of your integrity, and often causes some retribution to bounce back in the future."
  variations: 
    - swords
  cards: 
    - swords-05

sunflower:
  name: Sunflower
  desc: Sunflowers turn to follow the path of the sun through the sky, modeling the sort of attention paid to any sunny personality. Their shape and color emulates the object of their attention.
  cards: 
    - major-19
    - wands-13

sunset:
  name: Sunset
  desc: In many illustrations, it’s difficult to tell whether the sun is rising or setting. The ambiguity of the sun's direction here points to the ambiguous relationship between life and death.
  cards: 
    - major-15

swords:
  name: Swords
  desc: One of the four suits of the tarot. Also sometimes called blades, knives or athames. Represents logic, objectivity, intellect, and choice. Along with the responsibility such talents bring. Swords suggest logic, clarity, and decision-making. Remember the story of wise King Solomon, who once offered to slice a baby in half in order to resolve a dispute over motherhood? Swords cut through confusion, revealing our agendas in the process.

swords-in-back:
  name: Swords in Back
  desc: Optimistic users of the RWS claim the swords on the 10 of Swords pierce the pitiful figure’s charkas, yielding enlightenment through trial. Other decks show the figure face-up, suggesting the additional agony of seeing a bad situation coming.

taro:
  name: TARO
  desc: "Using TARO as an alternative spelling, occultists came up with an anagram: TAROT ROTA ORAT TORA ATOR, or “The Tarot speaks the law of Hathor.”(Hathor was an Egyptian goddess of motherhood and love.) The Hebrew letters spell out the unspeakable name of God. The symbols are alchemical glyphs for mercury, sulfur, water, and salt."

    - tora
  cards:

teamwork:

  cards: 
    - coins-03

tents:
  name: Tents
  desc: In the background of many RWS-inspired 7 of Swords, we see a cluster of distant tents. Is the figure in the foreground an outsider, come to steal? Or an insider, taking advantage of his own people?

threatening-wands:
  name: Threatening Wands
  desc: On the 7 of Wands from RWS-inspired decks, we often see a lone figure threatened by six rather threatening Wands. Six is the number of collaboration, suggesting that many people have come together to launch an attack. It's unclear if they're coming to hurt you, or if it's founded in some other intention and masked by miscommunication.
  variations: 
    - wands

three-tiered-crown:

  desc: Often, the Papess or High Priestess holds an unopened book, occasionally labeled TORA (“law”), an anagram of TARO.

tree-of-knowledge:
  name: Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil
  desc: Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil but were driven out of the Garden of Eden before they could partake of the Tree of Life and become “as gods.” Choices have consequences; note how RWS-influenced deck and the Marseilles deck all drive this point home.
  variations: 
    - tree-of-flames

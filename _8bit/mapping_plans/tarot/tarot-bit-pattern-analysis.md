# Tarot Bit Pattern Analysis

This document analyzes the optimal bit patterns for tarot cards based on their resource signatures.

## Methodology

1. Convert the resource signatures to binary recommendations:
   - Scores of 2 or 1 suggest a "1" bit
   - Scores of 0 or -1 suggest a "0" bit
   
2. Calculate the "fit score" between each card and each available bit pattern:
   - +2 points when a recommended "1" bit matches a "1" in the pattern
   - +1 point when a recommended "0" bit matches a "0" in the pattern

3. Identify the highest-scoring patterns for each card

4. Resolve conflicts through:
   - Prioritizing fixed cards (Moon, Sun)
   - Maintaining numerical order for Minor Arcana
   - Prioritizing cards with the most distinctive signatures

## Pattern Analysis for Major Arcana

### Fixed Cards
- **The Moon**: 000000 (fixed at beginning)
- **The Sun**: 111111 (fixed at end)

### High-Confidence Assignments
- **The World**: 111011 (best fit: nearly complete pattern, near Sun)
- **The Fool**: 100001 (intuition + options, beginning of journey)
- **The Magician**: 110100 (intuition + ability + expectations)
- **High Priestess**: 101001 (intuition + capacity + options, missing support)
- **The Emperor**: 011110 (ability + capacity + all outer resources)
- **The Hierophant**: 010110 (ability + expectations + support)
- **Death**: 100011 (intuition + support + options)
- **The Tower**: 000110 (only support + options remain after collapse)

### Medium-Confidence Assignments
- **The Empress**: 111100 (complete inner world + expectations)
- **The Lovers**: 100101 (intuition + expectations + options)
- **The Chariot**: 110010 (intuition + ability + support)
- **Strength**: 110001 (intuition + ability + options)
- **The Hermit**: 101000 (intuition + capacity only)
- **Wheel of Fortune**: 001110 (capacity + expectations + support)
- **Justice**: 011101 (ability + capacity + expectations + options)
- **The Hanged Man**: 100100 (intuition + expectations only)
- **Temperance**: 110110 (intuition + ability + expectations + support)
- **The Devil**: 001001 (capacity + options, but trapped)
- **The Star**: 101010 (intuition + capacity + support)
- **Judgement**: 011111 (everything except intuition)

## Pattern Analysis for Minor Arcana

Numerical progression suggests increasing resources:

- **Ace/1**: 000011 (minimal resources: support + options)
- **Two**: 010001 (ability + options)
- **Three**: 011000 (ability + capacity)
- **Four**: 001111 (capacity + all outer resources)
- **Five**: 000101 (expectations + options, during challenge)
- **Six**: 110011 (intuition + ability + support + options)
- **Seven**: 101110 (intuition + capacity + expectations + support)
- **Eight**: 011011 (ability + capacity + support + options)
- **Nine**: 101101 (intuition + capacity + expectations + options)
- **Ten**: 111010 (intuition + ability + capacity + expectations + support)

## Conflict Analysis

Several cards compete for similar patterns. Here are the main conflicts:

1. **The Fool vs. High Priestess**: Both want intuition-dominated patterns
2. **The Emperor vs. Justice**: Both want structured patterns with outer resources
3. **Death vs. The Devil**: Both represent challenging cards with specific resource needs
4. **The Star vs. Temperance**: Both represent balanced patterns with good integration

## Recommendation

Based on this analysis, we should prioritize:

1. Mathematical constraints (32 even parity patterns)
2. Fixed anchor points (Moon, Sun)
3. Intuitive bit meanings for the most iconic cards
4. Numeric progression for Minor Arcana

By evaluating each card's signature against available patterns, we can create an optimal mapping that satisfies our constraints.

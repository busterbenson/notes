## Overall Assessment

- **Excellent Matches**: 11 (34%)
- **Strong Matches**: 17 (53%)
- **Questionable Matches**: 4 (13%)
- **Weak Matches**: 0 (0%)

With 87% of cards having strong or excellent alignment, this mapping is highly successful while maintaining mathematical balance and creating a coherent narrative journey.

## Remaining Issues

1. **The Hanged Man (010001)** ⚠️
   - Missing intuition bit is significant for a card about spiritual insight
   - However, ability + options does capture suspended action with perspective

2. **Three (000110)** ⚠️
   - Growth usually involves ability (bit 2) or intuition (bit 1)
   - Current pattern (expectations + support) feels too externally focused

3. **Four (011101)** ⚠️
   - Too many resources for a basic foundation card
   - Pattern feels more advanced than its position in the numerical sequence

4. **Judgement (010111)** ⚠️
   - Missing intuition bit is problematic for spiritual awakening card
   - Though ability + all outer resources does capture the external call

## Tradeoff Analysis

In our refinement process, we made some compromises:

1. **Lost Excellent Mapping**: None
   - All cards previously rated as "Excellent" maintained their strong alignments
   - We successfully preserved the strongest associations while improving the weaker ones

2. **Improved Critical Cards**:
   - High Priestess: From ⚠️ to ✅✅
   - Temperance: From ⚠️ to ✅✅
   - The Devil: From ⚠️ to ✅
   - The Chariot: From ⚠️ to ✅

3. **New Tensions Created**:
   - Three: Weakened somewhat to improve other placements
   - Four: Now has more resources than its numerical position would suggest

## Potential Final Adjustments

If we wanted to make final minimal adjustments:

1. **Swap Hanged Man and Hermit**:
   - Move Hanged Man to 100100 (intuition + expectations)
   - Move Hermit to 010001 (ability + options)
   - This would give Hanged Man the intuition bit but might weaken Hermit

2. **Consider Three and Four placement**:
   - Three could be moved to a pattern with ability or intuition
   - Four could be moved to a simpler pattern with fewer resources

However, these adjustments would create new tensions elsewhere in the system. The current mapping represents an optimal balance given our constraints.

## Conclusion

This mapping achieves remarkable coherence while working within strict mathematical constraints:
1. All 32 bit patterns have even parity
2. The journey progresses meaningfully from Moon to Sun
3. Minor Arcana appear in numerical order
4. 87% of cards have strong or excellent alignment with their bit patterns

The remaining issues are minor and acceptable given the overall strength of the system. Any further adjustments would likely create as many problems as they solve, suggesting we've reached a near-optimal solution.

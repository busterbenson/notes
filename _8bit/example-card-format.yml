  # Direct Associations (these come directly from various associations to the bits and symbol systems)
  # These are hard-coded into our system and are inputs used to generate interpreted meanings
  direct_associations:

      # For the card_creature, use the gender determined by bit count:
      # - For 3 or 5 bits set to 1: Hero and Monster are feminine, Fool and Sage are masculine
      # - For 2 or 4 bits set to 1: Hero and Monster are masculine, Fool and Sage are feminine
      # - For 0 or 6 bits set to 1: All archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "[Description of the mythological figure or character that embodies this card's energy, with appropriate gender based on bit count]"
      question_posed: "[Question this card asks the querent]"
      card_scene: "[Detailed description of the card's imagery, incorporating all symbolic elements, colors, and archetype - maintain consistent gender representation]"

      # Image generation prompt - use this template but fill with specific details
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short scene description].
      Use [INNER WORLD COLOR] for foreground elements (inner world) and [OUTER WORLD COLOR] for background/environment (outer world), with [ACCENT COLOR] for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '[XXXXXXXX]' and card title '[CARD TITLE]' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature [key symbolic elements, e.g., moon phase, animal companions, symbolic object].
      The scene should evoke the mood of [MOOD KEYWORDS] and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for [SEASON].
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

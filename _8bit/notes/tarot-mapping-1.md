# Proposed Tarot-to-Bit Pattern Mapping

This document presents a proposed mapping of tarot cards to even-parity bit patterns, based on the analysis of resource signatures and bit pattern fitting.

## Mapping Structure

The mapping creates a journey from The Moon (000000) to The Sun (111111), with:
- Minor Arcana numbers distributed at regular intervals
- Major Arcana arranged to tell a coherent story of increasing illumination
- Bit patterns aligned with card meanings where possible
- Mathematical balance maintained throughout

3. **Three**: Expansion (capacity + support)
4. **Four**: Foundation (expectations + options)
5. **Five**: Challenge overcome (complete inner world + support)
6. **Six**: Harmony achieved (intuition + ability + expectations + options)

## Areas for Improvement

### Major Issues to Address

1. **The World (001111)** ❌
   - As the completion card before The Sun, it should have more active inner resources
   - Consider swapping with a pattern like 111110 or 111101

2. **Five (111010)** ❌
   - As a challenge card, Five should not have complete inner resources
   - Consider a pattern with fewer active bits

3. **The Empress (011000)** ⚠️
   - Missing intuition bit doesn't align with her nurturing nature
   - Consider swapping with a pattern that includes intuition

4. **High Priestess (101101)** ⚠️
   - Too many active bits for a card about mystery and the hidden
   - Consider a pattern with fewer active bits, emphasizing intuition

### Possible Swaps

Here are some potential swaps to improve the mapping:

1. **The World ↔ Judgement**
   - Move The World to 010111 (still not ideal, but better)
   - Move Judgement to 001111 (awakening from limited inner resources)

2. **Five ↔ Three**
   - Move Five to 001010 (challenges with limited resources)
   - Move Three to 111010 (growth with full inner resources)

3. **The Empress ↔ High Priestess**
   - Move The Empress to 101101 (intuition + capacity with expectations and options)
   - Move High Priestess to 011000 (withdrawn ability and capacity)

## Additional Improvement Strategies

1. **Create meaningful sub-sequences**
   - Group related cards together in the progression
   - Ensure narrative flow between adjacent cards

2. **Balance Major/Minor distribution**
   - Consider spacing Minor Arcana more evenly
   - Create mini-journeys between numbered cards

3. **Emphasize card polarities**
   - Ensure opposite cards have complementary bit patterns
   - For example, Devil/Star, Death/Sun should have meaningful pattern relationships

4. **Refine borderline cases**
   - Focus on improving the "Questionable" ratings to at least "Strong"
   - Be willing to make minor compromises on "Strong" ratings to fix "Weak" ones

By addressing these issues, we can further strengthen the alignment between tarot meanings and bit patterns while maintaining our mathematical constraints.

    desc: "The Receptive Fool represents innocent openness and childlike receptivity. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 2 (Kun/The Receptive) expressed through Spring's qualities of awakening and new beginnings. As the Fool in the cycle, this figure approaches receptivity with an innocent mind, completely open to what comes without judgment or expectation. With no inner or outer resources activated, but emerging into Spring's energy, there is a playful curiosity about surrendering to the flow of life. The innocence comes from approaching emptiness as an adventure rather than a strategy."

      card_creature: "A gender-neutral youth with features that could belong to any age or gender, covered in morning dew and flower petals. Their expression is one of pure wonder and openness, arms spread wide as if to embrace whatever the universe might bring. Their body seems almost translucent in the spring light, like a being newly formed and not yet fully defined."
      question_posed: "How might approaching life with beginner's mind and innocent receptivity reveal possibilities that your experience and expectations have been hiding from you?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral youthful figure stands in a meadow at dawn, their arms outstretched like a young tree reaching for the sun. Their clothing is minimal and undefined, neither masculine nor feminine in style, and so pale it seems to blend with their skin. Around them, the grass is wet with morning dew, reflecting the first light of day in countless tiny mirrors. The figure's shadow is barely visible, as if they have not yet accumulated enough substance to cast a full one. A crescent moon still hangs in the pale sky, though fading as dawn strengthens. Nearby, a clear spring bubbles up from the earth, forming a small pool where the figure's reflection appears sometimes clear and sometimes rippled, never quite fixed. Small seedlings push up through the soil around their bare feet, mirroring their own emergent quality. The figure holds an empty canvas and brush, but shows no sign of concern about what to paint – they seem content to simply receive whatever impressions come, with complete trust in the process."
      universal_symbol: "A blank canvas, pristine and full of potential"
      mood: "Innocent wonder, open curiosity, joyful acceptance"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral youthful figure standing in a morning meadow with arms outstretched.
      Use black for foreground elements (inner world) and black for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and pale yellow accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000010' and card title 'THE EMPTY CANVAS' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature dew-covered grass, a crescent moon, a clear spring, emerging seedlings, and a blank canvas held by the figure.
      The scene should evoke the mood of innocent wonder and joyful acceptance, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

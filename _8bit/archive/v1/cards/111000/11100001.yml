    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Strategic Harmony"
      card_creature: "A masterful warrior who stands confidently at the boundary between light and darkness, skillfully utilizing inner resources to create bridges across impossible divides, their hands shaping order from chaos with precise, practiced movements"
      question_posed: "How might you skillfully deploy your inner resources to create harmony when external support is scarce or absent?"
      card_scene: "A powerful figure stands at the threshold between two contrasting realms in the golden light of autumn. Their body radiates with white inner light that extends into the surrounding darkness with confident precision. A waning moon hangs in the sky, casting just enough light to highlight a single clear path forward through seemingly impossible terrain. The figure doesn't simply observe the contrast between fertile and barren landscapes but actively works to bridge them. With masterful expertise, they have constructed an impossible bridge spanning the divided realms using minimal materials – stones, branches, and other sparse resources transformed through skill into a stable structure. Their pack contains few tools, but each has been adapted for multiple purposes through ingenious design. Where the sage might conduct energy and the child might dance through it, this figure actively shapes it – hands moving with precision born from practice and confidence. The barren landscape shows signs of strategic intervention – channels carved to direct what little water exists, stone arrangements that maximize protection from harsh elements, carefully placed seeds in prepared soil awaiting future growth. Small animals move confidently across the bridge the figure has built, no longer separated by the divide. The figure's expression shows neither the serene wisdom of the sage nor the innocent wonder of the child, but rather the focused determination of one who knows exactly how to create harmony through masterful action. A torch of their own making burns with steady flame despite the lack of fuel, illuminating the darkness not through magical radiance but through skillful conservation of resources. Every element of the scene demonstrates the heroic mastery of inner resources against external limitation."
      universal_symbol: "The impossible bridge – masterful harmony created through skilled application of inner resources despite external scarcity"

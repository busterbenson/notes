    desc: "This card represents the profound wisdom that emerges when inner truth resonates with outer validation. It embodies the paradox of authentic self-expression – the inner world of intuition and ability mirroring the outer world of support and options – creating powerful harmonic resonance. In its Sage aspect in Summer, it reveals the transcendent understanding of how integrity creates ripple effects across all dimensions of existence."

      card_name: "Resonant Truth"
      card_creature: "A female sage whose body appears composed of concentric ripples of light and water, whose voice creates perfect geometric patterns in the air around her, holding a tuning fork that vibrates at the exact frequency needed to reveal the inner nature of everything it touches"
      question_posed: "Where in your life might deeper authenticity create resonance that extends beyond yourself?"
      card_scene: "A serene female sage sits at the center of a summer lake under the full moon, her body both solid and fluid, composed of concentric ripples that extend outward like sound waves. Her expression shows profound peace, neither forcing truth nor hiding it, but simply being it. As she speaks, her voice creates visible patterns in the air – sacred geometrical forms that reflect the underlying structure of reality. In her hand she holds a tuning fork that glows with inner light, vibrating at a frequency that causes everything it touches to reveal its true nature. The full moon overhead is reflected perfectly in the still lake, creating a mirrored reality where above and below are indistinguishable. The water's surface shows not just the sage's physical form but seems to reveal her innermost essence, demonstrating how complete authenticity erases the boundary between inner and outer worlds. Around her, various objects and beings respond to her resonant presence – flowers open, crystals arrange themselves in perfect lattices, and animals approach with natural trust rather than fear. At multiple scales, the same pattern repeats: the cellular structure visible in a leaf mimics the arrangement of people gathered at the lake's edge, which mirrors the stellar configuration in the night sky. The sage wears simple robes adorned with a pattern that seems to shift between wave forms, standing waves, and musical notation, symbolizing how truth manifests across different sensory dimensions. She has placed various objects in the water – a feather, a stone, a crystal, a seed – each creating its own ripple pattern that intersects with the others to form complex but harmonious interference patterns. These patterns create zones of both amplification and perfect stillness, showing how resonant truths can both energize and calm. The entire scene conveys the profound power that emerges when inner authenticity creates resonance with the outer world, generating harmonic effects that extend far beyond the individual."
      universal_symbol: "The tuning fork – the instrument that reveals the natural frequency of all it touches, representing how authentic truth creates resonance across all dimensions"
      mood: "Harmonic resonance, authentic presence, the profound alignment that occurs when inner truth meets outer validation, creating ripple effects across all scales of existence"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a serene female sage sitting at the center of a summer lake under a full moon, her body composed of concentric ripples that extend outward like sound waves, a glowing tuning fork in her hand creating visible geometric patterns in the air.
      Use YELLOW for foreground elements (inner world) and CYAN for background/environment (outer world), with deep purple and luminous white accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11001111' and card title 'RESONANT TRUTH' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a perfectly reflected full moon, sacred geometry patterns forming in air and water, creatures and plants responding to the resonance, and the same pattern visible at multiple scales (cellular, human, cosmic).
      The scene should evoke the mood of harmonic resonance and authentic presence, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer (Water/Summer symbols, still water allowing perfect reflection, the way water carries sound waves).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the sage as feminine, with graceful features and a serene, wise expression."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Monstrous Blockage"
      card_creature: "A beast-like figure trapped between abundant resources and a formidable barrier, transforming into something unrecognizable as frustration overwhelms reason, with muscles straining against immovable forces and eyes wild with desperation"
      question_posed: "What shadow aspects might be emerging in you when facing prolonged stagnation despite having external resources?"
      card_scene: "A grotesquely transformed figure stands before an enormous, seemingly impenetrable barrier in the harsh light of summer. Their body has begun to morph into something monstrous – muscles bulging unnaturally, veins protruding, jaw elongated into a snarl. A full moon hangs directly overhead, casting harsh shadows that exaggerate the figure's distorted features. The surrounding landscape is a paradox of abundance and blockage – lush summer growth surrounds them, yet they cannot move forward. Their pack, filled with valuable tools and resources, has been torn open in frustration, its contents scattered and broken around them. Their hollow inner appearance contrasts sharply with the abundant world around them, creating a visual representation of internal emptiness amid external plenty. A once-placid lake has dried to cracked mud behind them, symbolizing patience that has evaporated under pressure. Their fists pound helplessly against the barrier, which shows no sign of yielding despite repeated assaults. A boundary stone that once stood upright has been toppled and cracked by their rage. A dammed river nearby has begun to overflow violently, finding destructive alternate paths as its natural flow is obstructed. Other travelers can be seen in the distance, wisely keeping their distance from the monstrous figure's volatile energy. The air around them seems to warp and distort with heat and fury, and small animals flee from the emanating rage. Their eyes reflect a haunting mixture of desperation and madness – the shadow side of prolonged stagnation when all external resources fail to create movement."
      universal_symbol: "The overflowing dam – pressure building to destructive levels when natural movement is obstructed despite abundant energy"
      mood: "Overwhelming frustration, desperate rage, the shadow transformation that occurs when stagnation continues beyond tolerance despite having abundant resources"

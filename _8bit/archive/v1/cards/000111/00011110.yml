    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Strategic Blockage"
      card_creature: "A masterful tactician who stands before an immense barrier with maps and tools, methodically analyzing weak points and planning multiple paths around the obstacle while others have abandoned the journey"
      question_posed: "How might you approach your current obstacle with strategic skill rather than brute force or surrender?"
      card_scene: "A confident warrior stands before a seemingly impassable cliff face in a vibrant spring forest. Their posture conveys absolute competence despite the challenging terrain. A waxing moon provides clear light, illuminating the barrier and the surrounding landscape. The warrior has laid out several maps, compasses, and tools on a flat rock, methodically analyzing the obstacle from multiple angles. Their pack contains abundant resources and equipment, contrasting with their hollow or empty inner appearance. Several arrows are embedded in the cliff face, marking potential routes or weak points. Instead of attempting to climb directly over the barrier, they have begun engineering a system of wooden platforms and pulleys to navigate around it. A river that once flowed directly into the cliff has been skillfully diverted through a series of channels to create a new path. Fresh spring growth emerges around the diverted water, suggesting that the obstruction has inadvertently created new life. A boundary marker that once warned of the impassable terrain is now being used as a key component in the warrior's solution. Other travelers' abandoned equipment lies scattered at the base of the cliff, showing that many have given up where the warrior perseveres. The surrounding forest is alive with early spring energy – birds building nests, new leaves unfurling – symbolizing the creative potential within apparent standstill. The warrior's face shows concentrated determination and confidence, completely focused on transforming the obstacle into an opportunity through skillful application of their resources."
      universal_symbol: "The engineered diversion – the masterful redirection of energy around an immovable obstacle, creating new pathways where direct progress is impossible"
      mood: "Confident determination, strategic analysis, the masterful competence that emerges when obstacles are approached as puzzles to be solved rather than barriers to be fought"

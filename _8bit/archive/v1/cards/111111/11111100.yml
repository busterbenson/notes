      card_creature: "A gender-neutral creator whose hands shape light and matter with perfect skill and precision, neither masculine nor feminine but rather a pure embodiment of creative mastery. Their form combines the strength of a warrior with the precision of an artist, manifesting creative vision with disciplined expertise."
      question_posed: "What vision are you ready to manifest through disciplined creation and masterful skill?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands in a crystalline winter landscape, their form radiating clarity and purpose. They wear armor made of condensed light that serves as both protection and creative tool. In their hands, they manipulate floating geometric blueprints made of pure light, which immediately translate into physical form in the landscape around them. As they gesture, ice and snow reshape into intricate architectural structures, perfectly balanced between beauty and function. The winter sun casts long, precise shadows that the figure deliberately incorporates into their creation, using them as measuring tools and structural elements. Their breath, visible in the cold air, forms perfect geometric patterns that seem to solidify into crystalline structures before being integrated into the larger creation. Where they touch the ground, snow crystallizes into more perfect, geometrically precise patterns, enhancing rather than disrupting the natural environment. Around them, various precision tools float within easy reach – golden calipers, rulers, and chisels that seem to be extensions of their own being rather than separate implements. The entire scene communicates masterful creation – not through domination of materials, but through perfect understanding of their nature."
      universal_symbol: "The precision lens - focusing creative energy with exact purpose and skill"
      mood: "Masterful precision, creative discipline, strategic manifestation"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral figure in light armor manipulating geometric blueprints in a winter landscape.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and white for background/environment (outer world), with gold and crystalline blue accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11111100' and card title 'THE MASTER BUILDER' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature golden precision tools, light blueprints materializing into structures, geometric breath patterns, perfect snow crystals, and the new moon in a clear winter sky.
      The scene should evoke the mood of masterful precision and creative discipline, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

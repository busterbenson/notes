    desc: "The Clinging Fool represents the innocent curiosity and playful discovery of fire and attachment. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 30 (Li/The Clinging) expressed through Fall's qualities of change and letting go. As the Fool in the cycle, this figure approaches brightness and desire with childlike wonder rather than judgment. With intuition and capacity but lacking ability in the inner world, and expectations and options but lacking support in the outer world, this figure encounters the paradox of double fire energy with fresh eyes. The fool discovers joy in exploring flame and attachment that others approach with caution, bringing innocent curiosity to what seems dangerous."

      card_creature: "A wide-eyed female child discovering fire for the first time, approaching flame with innocent fascination rather than fear or caution, seeing the beauty of light without fully recognizing its capacity to consume"
      question_posed: "What might you discover if you approached your attachments with innocent curiosity rather than judgment or fear?"
      card_scene: "A female child sits in a clearing of an autumn forest at dusk, her face illuminated with magenta light from twin flames she's somehow conjured – one dancing above each palm. Unlike the female sage's controlled flames, these fires flicker and dance unpredictably, responding to the girl's delighted giggles. The child's eyes reflect pure wonder, seeing only the beauty of the fire without comprehending its potential dangers. A waning moon hangs low in the sky, its light creating a silvery path through the forest that intersects with the magenta glow from the girl's flames. Autumn leaves swirl around the clearing, some catching the firelight and momentarily appearing to burn without being consumed, creating spiraling patterns of illumination. The fallen leaves on the ground have arranged themselves in a pattern that mirrors the flames above, as if the earth itself is reflecting the fire element. Fireflies hover nearby, their intermittent glow seemingly in conversation with the more constant flames in the child's hands. The girl wears simple clothing adorned with patterns that resemble both flames and autumn leaves, blending the fire and earth elements. Around the clearing, small forest creatures watch with a mixture of curiosity and caution that the child lacks, representing the wisdom the Fool has yet to acquire. Several objects that clearly belong to adults – a lantern, a compass, matches – lie nearby, tools for controlling fire that she has temporarily abandoned in favor of direct experience. The entire scene conveys the innocent wonder of discovering attachment and desire without judgment, seeing the beauty of fire before learning its capacity to both illuminate and consume."
      universal_symbol: "The dancing flames – fire approached with innocent curiosity rather than fear or control, representing desire and attachment experienced through beginner's mind"
      mood: "Childlike wonder, innocent fascination, the joyful discovery that emerges when brightness and attachment are encountered with beginner's mind rather than judgment"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a wide-eyed female child sitting in a clearing of an autumn forest at dusk, hands held up with flames dancing above each palm, face illuminated with wonder and delight at the discovery of fire.
      Use MAGENTA for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and amber-gold accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10110101' and card title 'PLAYFUL FIRE' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon low in sky, autumn leaves swirling in illuminated patterns, curious forest animals watching from distance, and abandoned adult tools (lantern, compass, matches) lying nearby.
      The scene should evoke the mood of childlike wonder and innocent fascination, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall (Earth/Fall symbols, autumn leaves, earthy tones grounding the magenta fire, the balance of fire element against solid earth).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the child as a young girl, with feminine features and an expression of wonder and delight."

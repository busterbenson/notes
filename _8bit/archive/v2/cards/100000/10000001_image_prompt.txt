LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "OBSESSIVE VISION" (10000001)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the essence of the Obsessive Vision card - representing intuition that has become distorted through isolation, the knowing that transforms into delusion without external validation.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- MUST INCLUDE A CLEAR BORDER with all content 200px from all edges 
- All artwork and elements MUST remain within this 200px border - NOTHING should extend beyond this border
- This means the actual illustration area is 800x1600 pixels centered on the card
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Red (for inner world character's eyes and veins)
- Accent: Deep purple (representing the Monster archetype)
- Outer World: Black/dark browns for the autumn forest landscape
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A masculine monster with gaunt, haunted features and wild, unkempt appearance
- Eyes that glow with an unnatural red light, including a third eye occasionally visible in his forehead
- Emaciated yet imposing form with long, spidery fingers that seem to grasp at nothing
- Skin that appears almost translucent, with visible veins pulsing with the same red energy as the eyes
- Hair like a dark, tangled halo framing his face
- Body twisted in an unnatural posture, as if physical form is being distorted by mental energy
- Expression containing both profound insight and disturbing intensity

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- A decaying autumn forest with twisted, bare trees whose branches create neural network-like patterns
- A labyrinth of fallen leaves that spiral inward toward the figure at the center
- Multiple small pools of water scattered throughout the forest floor, each reflecting the monster's face in different, distorted ways
- Some sections of the forest appearing to shift and warp, blurring the boundary between reality and delusion
- Faint red glow from the figure's eyes reflected in the water pools, creating the only warm color in the scene
- A sense that the environment itself might be a projection of the figure's mind rather than objective reality
- No clear path in or out of the forest labyrinth

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete Dark Moon icon in upper right corner - a black circle with the faintest sliver of light beginning to appear at one edge
- This represents the Dark Moon Emerging phase - the precarious moment when new understanding begins to form after complete darkness
- The lunar symbol echoed in a larger moon visible through twisted branches overhead

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Warped reflections: Multiple water pools showing distorted versions of the monster's face, representing intuition twisted by isolation
- Labyrinth of leaves: Spiraling pattern of autumn leaves creating a maze with no clear path in or out, symbolizing being lost in one's own thoughts
- Neural branches: Tree branches forming patterns that resemble neural connections or conspiracy boards, showing the mind creating patterns in isolation
- Glowing eyes: Red illumination representing the inner fire of intuition that has become too intense and consuming without external moderation

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Feverish isolation - the uncomfortable intensity of being trapped with one's own thoughts
- Compelling distortion - the seductive quality of patterns that seem meaningful but may be fabricated
- Uncanny recognition - the feeling of seeing something that is simultaneously true and false
- Obsessive focus - the energy of attention directed too intensely at a single point

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "OBSESSIVE VISION" in bold, centered, all caps
- "10000001" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the monster as focal point surrounded by the spiral labyrinth of leaves and reflective pools

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create unsettling contrast between the red glowing elements and the dark autumn landscape
- Use twisted, irregular linework to convey the distortion of perception
- Apply warped reflection effects in the water pools to show different facets of the same figure
- Balance between recognizable forest elements and more abstract, psychological patterns
- Ensure the monster appears both frightening and pitiable - a figure who suffers from his own vision

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The danger of intuition that lacks external validation or expression
- How isolation can transform insight into delusion
- The addictive quality of pattern-recognition divorced from reality
- The fall season as a time when boundaries between worlds become thinner
- The monster archetype as intuition that has become dangerous through distortion

This card represents intuition that has festered in isolation, becoming a labyrinth of compelling but potentially delusional patterns. The image should evoke both the seductive power and the disturbing danger of visions that have no external reality check.

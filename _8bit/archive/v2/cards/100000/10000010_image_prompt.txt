LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "PLAYFUL HUNCH" (10000010)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the essence of the Playful Hunch card - representing pure intuition expressing itself through spontaneous play and experimentation, following hunches without concern for practicality.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- MUST INCLUDE A CLEAR BORDER with all content 200px from all edges 
- All artwork and elements MUST remain within this 200px border - NOTHING should extend beyond this border
- This means the actual illustration area is 800x1600 pixels centered on the card
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Red (for the kite, thread, and character's hair)
- Accent: Bright turquoise (representing the Fool archetype) for clothing and highlights
- Outer World: Black with emerging greens for the spring landscape
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A feminine fool with wild, windswept red hair that seems animated with its own energy
- Lithe, agile form caught mid-dance or mid-leap in a spontaneous movement
- Face showing an expression of delighted surprise and joyful discovery
- Eyes that sparkle with intuitive knowing and mischievous intelligence
- Wearing light, flowing garments in shades of turquoise that billow like spring clouds
- One hand holding a thin red thread that leads up to a kite in the sky
- Bare feet barely touching the ground, as if gravity has less hold on her than on others

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- An awakening spring meadow at dawn, still partially dormant but with new growth emerging
- Tiny green shoots sprouting wherever the figure's feet have touched the earth
- A thin red thread extending from the figure's hand up to a vibrant red kite flying overhead
- The kite flying without any apparent wind, suggesting it's guided by intuition rather than physical forces
- In the background, a labyrinth pattern that is unraveling into a single spiral path
- The horizon showing the first blush of dawn light, suggesting the threshold of something new
- A sense of vast openness and possibility despite the minimal landscape elements

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete New Moon icon in upper right corner - a thin crescent of light against darkness
- This represents the New Moon Birthing phase - the first visible emergence of light after complete darkness
- The lunar icon echoed by a larger crescent moon visible in the dawn sky above the scene

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Red kite: Flying without wind, representing intuition that guides without logical explanation
- Thin red thread: The connection between intuitive impulse and action, fragile but unbroken
- Sprouting seeds: New growth emerging from bare ground, showing how intuition creates where nothing existed
- Unraveling labyrinth: The simplification of complexity when following intuitive guidance, turning a maze into a clear path
- Dawn light: The threshold moment between darkness and light, representing the birth of new understanding

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Carefree spontaneity - the liberating feeling of following impulse without concern for consequences
- Delighted discovery - the joy of finding something unexpected through intuitive means
- Innocent experimentation - trying things without preconceptions or fear of failure
- Threshold anticipation - the excitement of standing at the beginning of something completely new

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "PLAYFUL HUNCH" in bold, centered, all caps
- "10000010" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the dancing figure as central focal point, with the red thread/kite creating visual movement upward

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create dynamic, flowing lines to convey the sense of movement and dance
- Use negative space effectively to suggest vastness and possibility
- Balance the minimalism of the winter-to-spring landscape with the vibrant energy of the figure
- Apply subtle texture to suggest the emergence of new growth from the earth
- Ensure the red elements (hair, thread, kite) create a visual through-line that guides the eye

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The liberating joy of following intuition without practical concerns
- How play and experimentation can reveal paths that logic would never find
- The spring-like quality of intuitive breakthroughs after periods of stillness
- The fool archetype as one who intuitively understands what others must learn through experience
- The new moon birthing phase as the first emergence of something previously hidden

This card represents intuition expressing itself through spontaneous play - the knowing that requires no external validation or practical application to be valuable. The image should evoke a sense of carefree joy and the exhilarating freedom that comes from following a hunch without needing to explain or justify it.

  basic_info:
    desc: "This card represents the empty canvas where all creation is possible. The 00000010 pattern captures the moment of pristine potential right before the first mark is made. In this Spring aspect, it manifests as the Fool who approaches emptiness with innocent creativity and spontaneous possibility. The New Moon Birthing phase perfectly mirrors this energy - the first visible sliver of light emerging from darkness, the beginning of a new cycle. Like an artist before a blank page or a child seeing the world anew, this card embodies the thrilling potential of the unwritten beginning."

      card_name: 'Unwritten Beginning'
      card_creature: "A neutral fool whose form appears youthful and fluid, poised on the threshold of creation. Neither distinctly male nor female, this figure embodies the innocent potential of the beginner's mind. They stand with one foot lifted as if taking the first step on an unmarked path, holding what appears to be a blank canvas or page that contains, paradoxically, all possibility. Their eyes are wide with wonder and their expression contains both anticipation and serenity."
      question_posed: "What beautiful possibility might emerge if you approached your situation with a beginner's mind, free from preconceptions?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure with a childlike, innocent quality stands at the edge of what appears to be a vast empty space that gradually transitions from complete darkness to a field of pristine white. The figure holds a blank canvas or page in one hand, while the other hand is raised as if about to make the first mark. The background suggests early spring - bare branches with the faintest hint of green buds, a few tiny seedlings emerging from otherwise barren ground. The sky shows the thinnest sliver of a new moon, barely visible against the night sky. Where the figure's foot touches the ground, the first hint of a path begins to form, yet the path ahead remains completely unmarked. There's a sense of hushed anticipation, as if the whole scene is holding its breath before the first act of creation. Small ripples or patterns in the empty space suggest infinite possibilities waiting to be manifested. The New Moon Birthing phase is represented by the slender crescent and the overall quality of emergence and initiation. The entire composition evokes Spring's essence - the fresh beginning that contains all potential futures."
      universal_symbol: "The blank canvas/empty page - representing the limitless potential of beginnings unbound by preconceptions"
      mood: "Innocent wonder, delicate emergence, the breathless anticipation before creation"

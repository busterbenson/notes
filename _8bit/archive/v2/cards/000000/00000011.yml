  basic_info:
    desc: "This card represents the perfectly formed empty vessel that waits to be filled. The 00000011 pattern captures the conscious mastery of emptiness as a form of receptivity. In this Summer aspect, it manifests as the Hero who has crafted emptiness into a deliberate state of readiness. The New Moon Strengthening phase perfectly mirrors this energy - the growing sliver of light that defines the vessel of darkness. This is not the void of absence but the deliberate creation of space - like a bowl whose value lies in its emptiness, or a clearing in a forest that allows light to enter and new growth to thrive."

      card_name: 'Perfect Vessel'
      card_creature: "A neutral hero whose form appears strong yet completely open, embodying receptivity as power rather than weakness. Neither distinctly male nor female, this figure has crafted their body into a perfect vessel through discipline and mastery. They stand in a clearing with hands cupped to receive light, their posture both grounded and spacious. Their eyes hold a serene awareness that true mastery lies not in filling space but in creating it."
      question_posed: "What perfect container are you creating that will allow abundance to naturally flow into your life?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands in a perfectly circular clearing in a lush summer forest. Sunlight streams down, illuminating the figure who stands with feet firmly planted and hands cupped together as if to receive water or light. The figure has crafted an empty bowl of exquisite simplicity that sits nearby on a flat stone. The clearing is meticulously maintained - not a space of absence but a deliberately created void that allows light to penetrate the forest canopy. This light nurtures a ring of flowers and plants that thrive around the clearing's edge, creating a living boundary between emptiness and fullness. The strengthening crescent moon is clearly visible in the daylight sky, its growing form echoed in the curve of the bowl and the figure's cupped hands. There's a sense of readiness and anticipation, but without urgency or grasping - the perfect state of receptivity that comes from mastery rather than lack. The New Moon Strengthening phase is represented by the growing crescent and the overall quality of emptiness being deliberately shaped and defined. The entire composition evokes Summer's essence - the mastery that comes from abundance channeled into perfect form."
      universal_symbol: "The perfectly formed empty bowl - representing emptiness as a conscious creation rather than an absence"
      mood: "Masterful receptivity, deliberate openness, the power of prepared space"

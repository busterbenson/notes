LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "DEVOURING VOID" (00000001)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the essence of the Devouring Void card - representing the consuming yet generative force of darkness that simultaneously creates space for new beginnings.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- NO decorative borders or frames around the illustration
- Allow natural margins (5-8% of width) between content and card edges
- Content should NOT touch the very edges - leave appropriate breathing room
- The illustration should use traditional tarot card-style layout with natural margins
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Black (for both inner world character and outer world environment)
- Accent: Deep violet-purple highlights (representing the Monster archetype)
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights
- Some graduated values of black to create depth in the void

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A gender-neutral monster whose form appears as an amorphous, ever-shifting darkness with a consuming maw
- Neither masculine nor feminine, but a formless, primal entity beyond gender
- The figure should appear as a shadow that both absorbs and creates - its edges constantly shifting and flowing
- The central feature should be a vast, consuming maw-like opening that pulls everything toward it
- The monster's form should have no clear boundaries, with parts of it stretching outward like tendrils of darkness
- Despite its consuming nature, from the darkest center of the entity, allow the faintest glimmers of new growth to emerge
- The monster represents the necessary destructive force that precedes creation - like compost that enables new life

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- A late autumn forest setting with bare trees and a ground covered in decay
- Autumn leaves and decaying matter swirling as if being pulled into the darkness at the center
- At the edge where matter meets the void, create a distortion effect like an event horizon - where matter stretches and elongates as it's pulled in
- Within the darkest center of the void, barely perceptible, include tiny seeds and the faintest glimmer of new potential
- The background suggests the necessary end of a cycle, with rotting fruit split open to reveal seeds
- The entire scene creates a stark threshold - a boundary between existence and non-existence

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete dark moon icon in upper right corner - a black circle with barely visible thin crescent
- This represents the Dark Moon Emerging phase - the transition point from complete darkness to the first hint of light
- The thin crescent should echo the faint spark of creation within the darkest part of the consuming void

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Devouring maw: The central opening that consumes everything, representing necessary dissolution
- Event horizon: The edge effect where matter distorts as it approaches the void, representing the threshold between states
- Falling leaves: Autumn elements being absorbed into the darkness, representing the cyclical nature of endings
- Seeds within darkness: Tiny seed shapes barely visible in the deepest part of the void, representing new beginnings contained within endings
- Rotting fruit: Split open organic matter revealing seeds, symbolizing how decay enables rebirth

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Threshold awareness - the feeling of standing between worlds or states of being
- Transformative dissolution - the understanding that destruction is part of the creative process
- Necessary ending - acceptance that certain things must be fully consumed before rebirth
- Paradoxical beginning - the sensation that within the deepest darkness, something new is emerging

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "DEVOURING VOID" in bold, centered, all caps
- "00000001" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the void centered or slightly off-center

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create dynamic tension between the consuming darkness and the faint glimmers of emergence
- Use flowing, organic lines to suggest constant movement and transformation
- Apply texture that suggests both decomposition and the first stirrings of new life
- Emphasize the threshold quality - the precise moment between ending and beginning
- Ensure the monster aspect feels like a natural force rather than something malevolent

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The necessary role of dissolution and decay in the creative cycle
- The paradox that destruction and creation are ultimately the same process seen from different perspectives
- Fall's essence as the season of necessary release and return to the earth
- The monster archetype as the force that devours the old to make way for the new
- The Dark Moon Emerging as the transitional moment when absolute darkness begins its transformation

This card represents the consuming void that simultaneously makes space for creation - the necessary destructive aspect of the creative cycle. The image should evoke both the fear of being consumed and the understanding that this process is essential for renewal.

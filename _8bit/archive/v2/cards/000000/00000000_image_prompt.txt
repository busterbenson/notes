LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "VOID MIRROR" (00000000)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that captures the profound essence of the Void Mirror card - representing the deepest darkness as a foundation of all potential rather than mere emptiness.

CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- NO decorative borders or frames around the illustration
- Allow natural margins (5-8% of width) between content and card edges
- Content should NOT touch the very edges - leave appropriate breathing room
- The illustration should use traditional tarot card-style layout with natural margins
- Bottom 15% contains the title bar area with a clean horizontal line separation
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Visible texture and grain throughout all elements
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Black (for both inner world character and outer world environment)
- Accent: Iridescent silver-blue highlights (representing the Sage archetype)
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Use black for all outlines and details with varying line weights
- Some graduated values of black to create depth in the void

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (INNER WORLD):
- A gender-neutral sage whose body appears only as a silhouette of tiny stars against deeper darkness
- Neither masculine nor feminine, but a timeless, cosmic presence beyond gender
- Where eyes should be, render two perfectly circular voids that paradoxically reflect back at the viewer
- The figure's outline should be defined by tiny pinpricks of starlight, creating a constellation-like effect
- Body stance should convey absolute stillness and perfect acceptance of the void
- The figure holds an obsidian mirror in one hand - a pure black reflective surface that seems to contain everything while showing nothing
- Their other hand might be slightly extended in a gesture of offering or revealing
- The figure should appear both merged with the darkness yet somehow distinct from it - a conscious presence within void

SCENE DESCRIPTION (OUTER WORLD):
- Absolute darkness as the environment, with graduated shades of black creating a sense of vast depth
- No horizon line, no landscape, only different densities of darkness extending in all directions
- Around the figure's feet, create ripple-like patterns in the void, as if space-time itself is a fluid medium
- These ripples should radiate outward from where the figure stands, suggesting that presence creates impact even in emptiness
- If possible, subtle geometric ice crystal formations might float in the darkness, representing Winter's element
- The figure's breath might be barely visible as crystallized in the cold void

LUNAR PHASE REPRESENTATION:
- Small, discrete dark moon icon in upper right corner - a completely black circle with no illumination
- This represents the Dark Moon Deepening phase - the moment of complete darkness before any emergence
- The dark moon should echo the void eyes of the sage figure

SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Obsidian mirror: A perfectly polished black surface that reflects nothing yet paradoxically seems to contain everything
- Starlit silhouette: The figure's body defined only by tiny stars, representing consciousness within void
- Ripples in space-time: Concentric patterns surrounding the figure's feet, showing that even in apparent emptiness, presence creates effects
- Crystallized breath: Barely visible geometric patterns of ice crystals that might form from the figure's breath in the cold void

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Profound acceptance - the image should evoke a sense of peace within darkness, not fear
- Mysterious anticipation - a feeling that something immense is about to emerge from the void
- Serene recognition - the wisdom that all creation must begin with emptiness
- Paradoxical depth - the darkness should feel vast, infinite, yet somehow intimate

LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "VOID MIRROR" in bold, centered, all caps
- "00000000" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling the space above the title bar
- Strong composition with the figure slightly off-center

ARTISTIC DIRECTION:
- Create strong contrast between the starlit silhouette and the deeper void
- Use minimal elements to convey maximum meaning
- Apply halftone or similar effects for gradient transitions
- Blend Rider-Waite symbolism with modern abstract interpretation
- Emphasize the paradoxical nature of the void as potential rather than emptiness

SYMBOLIC MEANINGS TO CONVEY:
- The void as the necessary foundation of all creation
- Wisdom found in embracing rather than fearing darkness
- The paradox that what appears as nothing contains infinite potential
- The sage as one who has transcended fear of emptiness and sees its true nature
- Winter's stillness as a time of hidden preparation and dormant potential

This card represents the ultimate state of receptivity - not as passivity but as the profound wisdom that creation requires space. The image should evoke both mystery and revelation, darkness and potential.

# Resonant Seasons and Archetypes
# Determined by Inner World (bits 1-3) and Outer World (bits 4-6)
# Inner: 0 if 2+ bits are 0, 1 if 2+ bits are 1
# Outer: 0 if 2+ bits are 0, 1 if 2+ bits are 1

# These combine to create a resonant season:
# Inner-Outer = 0-0 → archetype 00 = Fool (gender neutral), archetype highlight color: Turquoise
# Inner-Outer = 1-0 → archetype 10 = Hero (both masculine and feminine aspects), archetype highlight color: Gold
# Inner-Outer = 1-1 → archetype 11 = Monster (gender neutral), archetype highlight color: Purple
# Inner-Outer = 0-1 → archetype 01 = Sage (both masculine and feminine energies), archetype highlight color: Iridescent

# The resonant_season determines when that card is a Sage.
# The remaining archetypes are determined by the cycle of seasons
# If their resonant_season is winter, that means that their 00000000 card is a sage, 
# the 00000010 card is a fool (in spring), and they're a hero in the summer, and a monster in the fall.
# If their resonant_season is summer, that means that 11111111 is a sage (in summer), a fool in the fall,
# a hero in the winter, and a monster in the spring.

      card_name: "First Disillusionment"
      card_creature: "A wide-eyed female child who has just discovered a fundamental deception, her fingers touching a mirage that dissolves at her touch, her expression a mixture of wonder, confusion, and the first dawning of a more complex understanding of reality"
      question_posed: "Where might you recapture the moment of innocent questioning when you first realized things are not always as they appear?"
      card_scene: "A young girl stands in a spring meadow, her hand reached out to touch what appeared to be a beautiful butterfly, only to discover it's an optical illusion created by intersecting light patterns. Unlike the female sage's penetrating wisdom or mastery of illusion, the child's expression shows the mixed emotions of first disillusionment – confusion, wonder, and the dawning of a more complex understanding. The waxing moon above creates multiple reflections in puddles scattered across the meadow, each showing a slightly different phase of the moon, creating a visual puzzle that challenges perception. Around her, spring brings forth numerous natural illusions – flowers that appear to be insects to attract pollinators, puddles that seem shallow but hide unexpected depths, and mirages forming on the warm horizon. The child holds a soap bubble wand, having just created bubbles that captured miniature rainbows only to pop and disappear moments later, teaching an early lesson about beauty and impermanence. Near her feet lies a colorful mask that she has just picked up and tried on, discovering for the first time the strange experience of presenting a different face to the world than what she feels inside. Other children play nearby, still fully immersed in games of pretend, untroubled by the boundaries between imagination and reality that she has just begun to question. Various toys and objects around her demonstrate principles of illusion – a kaleidoscope showing how simple elements create complex patterns, a half-glass of water that bends light to make a pencil appear broken, a spinning top that blurs into colors different from its actual surface. A small magnifying glass rests on a rock nearby – the first tool of investigation she has begun to use to examine whether things are truly as they appear. The entire scene captures the poignant moment of first encountering the gap between appearance and reality – a necessary disillusionment that is the beginning of wisdom, approached with the openness and wonder of a child rather than the cynicism that sometimes follows."
      universal_symbol: "The popping bubble – the beautiful illusion that disappears when touched, representing the fragile nature of appearances when first examined"
      mood: "Innocent wonder, confused questioning, the poignant discovery that emerges when childlike perception encounters the gap between appearance and reality"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a wide-eyed young girl in a spring meadow, her hand reaching toward what appeared to be a butterfly that dissolves into light patterns at her touch, her expression showing confusion and wonder.
      Use BLUE for foreground elements (inner world) and RED for background/environment (outer world), with gold and bright spring green accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110010' and card title 'FIRST DISILLUSIONMENT' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waxing moon creating multiple different reflections in puddles, soap bubbles carrying miniature rainbows before popping, a colorful mask lying at her feet, and other children still playing games of pretend in the background.
      The scene should evoke the mood of innocent wonder and confused questioning, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring (Fire/Spring symbols, the way spring light creates mirages, how new growth can create deceptive impressions).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the child as a young girl, with feminine features and an expression mixing wonder, confusion, and dawning realization."

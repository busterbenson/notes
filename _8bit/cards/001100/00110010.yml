      card_creature: "A feminine child with eyes full of wonder as she discovers the intricate details of the world for the first time. Her posture combines the curiosity of natural exploration with the unexpected stillness of intense focus, embodying the innocence that allows true seeing without preconception."
      question_posed: "Where might approaching precision with childlike wonder and without perfectionism bring joy to your life?"
      card_scene: "A young girl with flowing hair kneels in a spring meadow, completely absorbed in examining a butterfly that has landed on her finger. Unlike an adult scientist with years of taxonomic knowledge, she sees the butterfly's wing patterns with fresh eyes, noticing details that others might overlook through familiarity. Scattered around her are simple tools of measurement and observation – a magnifying glass, a ruler, a prism – all being used in playful ways that sometimes yield surprising insights precisely because they aren't bound by conventional methodology. The spring setting provides endless objects of fascination, from the geometric precision of unfurling leaves to the mathematical spirals of new fern fronds. The girl has created a small arrangement of objects sorted by almost imperceptible variations in color, size, and texture – a natural laboratory of observation without rigid categorization. The waxing moon is visible in the afternoon sky, and she has been using puddles of water as mirrors to observe it from multiple angles simultaneously. In the background, adult figures can be seen with their attention directed elsewhere, unaware of the world of minute details the child has discovered. Unlike the obsessive intellectualizer who gets lost in analysis, her face shows pure joy in discovery, her precision coming from fascination rather than need for control. A small notebook beside her contains drawings of her observations – not technically perfect but capturing essential details that more polished illustrations might miss."
      universal_symbol: "The butterfly wing – intricate natural precision that reveals itself to patient, wonder-filled observation"
      mood: "Innocent discovery, fascinated attention, the joy of seeing details freshly without preconception"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a young girl with flowing hair kneeling in a spring meadow, absorbed in examining a butterfly that has landed on her finger.
      Use blue for foreground elements (inner world) and red for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and spring green accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110010' and card title 'THE WONDER OBSERVER' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a magnifying glass, a collection of objects sorted by subtle variations, unfurling leaves with visible geometric patterns, and a waxing moon visible in the daytime sky.
      The scene should evoke the mood of innocent discovery and fascinated attention, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

    desc: "The Small Exceeding Sage represents the wisdom of precision and subtle refinement. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 62 (Xiao Guo/Small Exceeding) expressed through Winter's qualities of clarity and subtlety. As the most integrated form of this hexagram, the Winter Sage embodies the transcendent understanding that comes from meticulous attention to detail without obsession. With inner capacity but no intuition or ability, and outer expectations without support or options, this figure navigates the delicate balance of slight imbalance with deep wisdom. The sage understands how small refinements can lead to perfection without getting lost in intellectualization."

    # Oracle card creation

      card_name: "The Precise Observer"
      # 2 bits set to 1, so Sage is feminine
      card_creature: "A feminine sage with eyes that can perceive the smallest details and hands that can adjust the most intricate mechanisms with perfect accuracy. Her form combines the stability of a mountain with the gentle movement of wind, embodying the capacity to observe with perfect precision while maintaining a holistic perspective."
      question_posed: "Where in your life might perfect attention to detail lead to wisdom rather than obsession?"
      card_scene: "A feminine sage sits in a winter observatory, her silver-streaked hair flowing around her face like wind currents made visible. Before her is a table with an array of precision instruments – scales that can measure a snowflake's weight, lenses that reveal a crystal's atomic structure, clocks that mark microseconds. The sage holds a perfect snowflake between delicate fingers, studying its intricate pattern with eyes that miss nothing yet remain soft with wonder rather than rigid with analysis. Around her, winter air provides perfect clarity, each breath visible as precisely formed frost patterns that echo fractal mathematics. The walls of her observatory are transparent, revealing a winter landscape where small details tell important stories – animal tracks that reveal precise movements, ice formations that show exact temperature changes, star positions that allow perfect navigation. On scrolls nearby are mathematical formulas and diagrams showing the balance points of complex systems where tiny adjustments create harmony. Unlike the obsessive intellectualizer who gets lost in details, the sage's expression shows transcendent understanding – she sees how each small refinement contributes to the whole without becoming fixated on perfection for its own sake. Her hands occasionally make microscopic adjustments to the instruments around her, each movement precise yet relaxed, showing mastery that comes from understanding rather than rigid control. The new moon visible through the observatory dome provides just enough light to work by, emphasizing how minimal input can be sufficient when precision guides action."
      universal_symbol: "The perfect snowflake – naturally occurring precision that combines mathematical exactitude with ephemeral beauty"
      mood: "Refined awareness, transcendent precision, the peace of perfectly balanced details"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a feminine sage with silver-streaked hair studying a perfect snowflake in a winter observatory filled with precision instruments.
      Use blue for foreground elements (inner world) and red for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and silver accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110000' and card title 'THE PRECISE OBSERVER' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature precision scales, measuring instruments, mathematical diagrams, visible breath forming frost patterns, and a new moon visible through a glass dome.
      The scene should evoke the mood of refined awareness and transcendent precision, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

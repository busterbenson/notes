      card_name: "Illusion Navigator"
      card_creature: "A confident male figure who moves with perfect skill through a landscape of deceptions and mirages, using specialized tools to detect false appearances, guiding others safely through terrain where nothing is quite what it seems"
      question_posed: "How might you develop expertise in navigating the gap between appearances and reality in your life?"
      card_scene: "A focused male figure traverses a summer landscape filled with optical illusions, mirages, and deceptive appearances. Unlike the female sage's transparent wisdom or the female child's confused wonder, this man actively navigates the territory between appearance and reality with confident expertise. His movements show perfect precision as he steps surely across what appears to be solid ground but reveals dangerous sinkholes to the untrained eye. The full moon overhead illuminates everything with unusual clarity, yet creates multiple shadow patterns that further complicate perception for the inexperienced. The man carries an assortment of specialized tools for detecting and measuring the gap between appearance and reality – perhaps instruments for detecting hidden structures, gauges that measure true versus apparent distance, or lenses that reveal spectra invisible to the naked eye. He uses these with the easy competence of long practice. The summer landscape itself seems to shimmer with heat mirages, creating false horizons and phantom water sources that would fatally mislead the unprepared traveler. Yet the navigator has marked a safe path through this deceptive terrain with subtle indicators that would be invisible to those without training. Several people follow behind him at a distance, clearly relying on his expertise to traverse the dangerous landscape safely. They carry supplies and equipment, suggesting this navigation has substantial practical purpose rather than being merely theoretical. The man's expression shows neither the sage's compassionate detachment nor the child's confusion, but rather the intense concentration of someone performing difficult work that has become second nature through mastery. Various natural phenomena in the scene demonstrate principles of illusion – heat mirages creating false water, plants mimicking more dangerous species for protection, animals with camouflage that makes them nearly invisible until the navigator points them out. The entire scene conveys the powerful competence that emerges when one develops practical mastery in discerning truth from illusion – not merely seeing through deception philosophically, but developing functional expertise in navigating landscapes where appearance differs from reality."
      universal_symbol: "The navigator's compass – the specialized tool that maintains true direction despite deceptive surroundings, representing the capacity to maintain orientation in the midst of illusion"
      mood: "Masterful discernment, confident navigation, the powerful competence that emerges when one develops practical expertise in distinguishing appearance from reality"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a confident male figure traversing a summer landscape filled with optical illusions and mirages, using specialized instruments to detect false appearances while guiding others safely through deceptive terrain.
      Use BLUE for foreground elements (inner world) and RED for background/environment (outer world), with deep purple and silver-blue accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110011' and card title 'ILLUSION NAVIGATOR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a full moon creating multiple shadow patterns, heat mirages creating false horizons, a specialized compass or detection tool in the navigator's hand, subtle trail markers visible only to the trained eye, and followers at a distance relying on his expertise.
      The scene should evoke the mood of masterful discernment and confident navigation, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer (Water/Summer symbols, the way water creates reflection and refraction, how summer heat creates natural mirages).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the navigator as masculine, with strong features and an expression of focused concentration."

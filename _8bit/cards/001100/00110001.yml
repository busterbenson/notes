    desc: "The Small Exceeding Monster represents the shadow of precision when it becomes excessive perfectionism. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 62 (Xiao Guo/Small Exceeding) expressed through Fall's qualities of decline and letting go. As the Monster in the cycle, this figure distorts precision into obsession, lost in minutiae while missing the whole. With inner capacity but no intuition or ability, and outer expectations without support or options, this figure becomes trapped in endless analysis and correction. The monster transforms refinement into a destructive force, where the pursuit of perfect detail becomes a prison."

      card_creature: "A masculine figure consumed by the pursuit of impossible perfection, his mind splintered into endless analysis of minutiae. His form combines the rigidity of mountain with chaotic wind currents, embodying the destructive outcome when precision loses connection with purpose."
      question_posed: "Where in your life has the pursuit of perfection become destructive rather than refining?"
      card_scene: "A gaunt masculine figure sits hunched in an autumn workshop littered with abandoned projects, each discarded for imperceptible flaws. Unlike the sage's transcendent wisdom, the child's innocent discovery, or the hero's masterful achievement, this figure has become consumed by impossible standards of precision. His workspace is illuminated by the harsh light of a waning moon that casts exaggerated shadows, making every minor imperfection seem monstrous. His hands, once skilled, have become cramped into rigid claws from endless attempts at perfect execution, while his eyes are bloodshot from manic focus on details invisible to others. Around him, hundreds of autumn leaves have been meticulously arranged in patterns of decreasing size and increasing precision, yet he continues to tear apart his work at the slightest deviation. Measuring instruments of extraordinary sensitivity cover every surface – calipers that measure to microns, scales that detect the weight of dust, clocks that mark nanoseconds – yet all have been declared inadequate by their owner. The workshop floor is littered with manuscripts covered in obsessive corrections, projects abandoned just before completion, and precision tools thrown aside in frustration. In one corner stands a bookshelf filled with reference materials, each tome dog-eared and annotated to the point of illegibility. What began as the gift of precision has become its shadow of intellectualization – this figure has lost all perspective, missing the purpose of his work while drowning in analytical detail. Most disturbing is his expression – a mixture of suffering and compulsion that shows he cannot stop his pursuit of impossible standards despite knowing it destroys everything he creates. In the corner, a nearly finished clockwork masterpiece sits abandoned, a single imperceptible flaw having rendered months of work 'worthless' in his distorted perception."
      universal_symbol: "The broken measuring tool – precision that has exceeded its useful limits and fractured under its own demanding standards"
      mood: "Obsessive perfectionism, paralyzing analysis, the destructive state that emerges when refinement loses perspective and becomes an end in itself"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gaunt masculine figure hunched over in an autumn workshop littered with abandoned projects and obsessively arranged autumn leaves, surrounded by ultra-precise measuring instruments.
      Use blue for foreground elements (inner world) and red for background/environment (outer world), with purple and copper-brown accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110001' and card title 'THE OBSESSIVE PERFECTIONIST' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature hands cramped into rigid claws, bloodshot eyes, manuscripts covered in endless corrections, shattered precision tools, a nearly-finished clockwork abandoned for a single flaw, and the waning moon visible through a window.
      The scene should evoke the mood of obsessive perfectionism and paralytic analysis, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

  basic_info: 
    desc: "This card represents the shadow side of deceptive appearances when they consume identity itself. It shows the dangerous transformation when one becomes the illusion – the inner world of capacity without intuition or ability merged with the outer world of expectations without support or options – intensified to the point of complete disconnection from reality. In its Monster aspect in Fall, it reveals how facades can overwhelm authenticity until the mask consumes the wearer."

      card_name: "Consuming Facade"
      card_creature: "A male figure whose identity has been consumed by his own deceptions, his body dissolving into hundreds of contradictory masks and reflections, unable to distinguish between the illusions he created and his actual self which has become lost in the process"
      question_posed: "Where might you be in danger of becoming so identified with appearances that you lose connection with your authentic self?"
      card_scene: "A grotesquely transformed male figure stands at the center of an autumn landscape that has become a hall of mirrors, his body no longer maintaining a coherent form but dissolving into countless masks, reflections, and constructed identities. Unlike the female sage's penetrating wisdom, the female child's innocent questioning, or the male hero's skilled navigation, this figure has lost all distinction between illusion and reality. His form appears to be composed entirely of masks and fragments of false personas that once served as tools but have now fused with his being. A waning moon hangs low in the sky, but its reflection appears in hundreds of mirrors throughout the scene, each showing a slightly different phase, color, or orientation – creating a visual cacophony where the true moon can no longer be identified. The autumn landscape itself seems uncertain of its nature – leaves appear frozen in mid-fall yet somehow still attached to branches, colors shift unpredictably, and physical laws seem to operate inconsistently in different parts of the scene. The figure's expression – or rather expressions, as his face constantly shifts between different masks – shows a desperate search for something solid amid the cascade of appearances. Tools similar to those carried by the Hero navigator lie shattered and useless at his feet, having failed when turned upon illusions that had been internalized rather than remaining external. Mirrors positioned throughout the scene create infinite regresses of reflection, with each iteration showing a slightly different version of the figure and landscape, suggesting the endless hall of distortion that opens when appearance fully disconnects from reality. Various natural and artificial objects in the scene demonstrate the same pattern of identity consumption – a chameleon that has shifted colors so many times it has lost its original form, buildings whose facades have grown to replace their actual structures, maps that have been altered to match inaccurate territories rather than representing reality. The entire scene conveys the terrifying transformation that occurs when the gap between appearance and reality grows so great that authentic identity is lost, leaving only a cascade of contradictory facades with nothing solid beneath."
      universal_symbol: "The endless hall of mirrors – reflections creating infinite regress with each showing a different distortion, representing how identity dissolves when facades multiply without foundation"
      mood: "Identity dissolution, consuming facade, the terrifying state that emerges when one becomes so identified with appearances that authentic self is lost entirely"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a grotesquely transformed male figure at the center of an autumn landscape turned hall of mirrors, his body dissolving into countless contradictory masks and reflections, unable to maintain coherent form.
      Use BLUE for foreground elements (inner world) and RED for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and copper-brown accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00110001' and card title 'CONSUMING FACADE' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon reflected in multiple mirrors each showing different phases, autumn leaves frozen in mid-fall yet still attached to branches, shattered navigation tools at the figure's feet, and mirrors creating infinite regresses of reflection with slight differences in each iteration.
      The scene should evoke the mood of identity dissolution and consuming facade, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall (Earth/Fall symbols, falling leaves that never quite land, the solid element of earth becoming unstable and shifting).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the figure as masculine with features constantly shifting between different masks and identities."

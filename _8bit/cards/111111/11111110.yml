      card_creature: "A sunlit child exploring a spring landscape, discovering how light makes everything new"
      question_posed: "What would you perceive if you could see everything clearly but without judgment or expectation?"
      card_scene: "A child stands in a clearing surrounded by trees in spring bloom, their face and body illuminated by light filtering through fresh green leaves and colorful blossoms. The child's eyes are wide with wonder, reflecting perfect miniature suns. They hold a newly sprouted leaf up to the light, examining its intricate patterns with complete absorption. Each blossom around them acts as a natural stained glass, creating patches of colored light on the fresh grass. The child is reaching out to touch one particularly bright patch of light, with an expression suggesting they believe it might be something they can pick up and hold. A small prism hangs from a branch nearby, casting rainbow patterns that the child hasn't yet noticed but will soon discover."
      universal_symbol: "The prism - pure light revealing its hidden complexity when experienced with fresh perception"
      mood: "Innocent clarity, pristine awareness, the joy of unfiltered perception"

      card_creature: "A gender-neutral child-like being whose form shifts and morphs with each creative impulse, neither distinctly masculine nor feminine but rather a spontaneous expression of creative joy. Their body seems composed of autumn light and scattered leaves, constantly reconfiguring into new shapes and patterns with innocent delight."
      question_posed: "Where in your life might you benefit from approaching creation with a beginner's mind, finding joy in the process rather than focusing on outcomes?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral child-like figure dances through a fall meadow at harvest time, their body seeming to form and reform from swirling autumn leaves and golden light. Their appearance shifts fluidly between different ages, forms, and expressions, maintaining only the consistent quality of innocent joy. Around them, the meadow brims with abundance – ripe fruits, colorful leaves, and harvest bounty – all of which the figure interacts with in spontaneous play. They capture falling leaves and reshape them into improvised toys and temporary sculptures before releasing them back to the wind. In one hand, they hold a kaleidoscope through which they occasionally peer, delighted by each new pattern that emerges. Their laughter seems to manifest visibly as bursts of light that cause nearby seeds to sprout briefly into fantastical plants before returning to seed form. A waning moon hangs in the afternoon sky, its partial illumination creating shadows that the figure incorporates into their creative play. Everywhere the figure touches, colors become more vibrant and textures more intricate, not through conscious effort but simply as a natural expression of their joyful presence. Their footsteps leave temporary mandalas in the earth, complex patterns that slowly fade back to natural terrain."
      universal_symbol: "The kaleidoscope - endless new patterns formed from the same elements, each configuration a temporary joy"
      mood: "Spontaneous delight, innocent wonder, playful discovery"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral child-like figure dancing through a fall harvest meadow, their body partially formed from swirling leaves and light.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and white for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and warm autumn orange/yellow accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11111101' and card title 'THE JOYFUL CREATOR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon, improvised leaf sculptures, a kaleidoscope, footprints forming mandala patterns, and bursts of light causing fantastical temporary growth.
      The scene should evoke the mood of spontaneous delight and playful discovery, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

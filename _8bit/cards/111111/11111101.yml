    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations

      card_name: "Merciless Exposure"
      card_creature: "A solar tyrant whose gaze leaves nothing hidden and whose light transforms everything it touches into distorted versions of themselves"
      question_posed: "What truths have become so overwhelming that they've distorted your ability to function within normal boundaries?"
      card_scene: "A terrifying autumn sun dominates the entire upper portion of the scene, its rays so intense they appear to be physically pressing down on the landscape below. The sun's face is multi-eyed and unblinking, examining everything with merciless scrutiny. Falling leaves freeze mid-air, caught in the harsh light that reveals every imperfection and flaw. Harvest fields bend and crack under the pressure of too much illumination, with fruits and grains bursting open, revealing too much of their inner structure. The relentless sunlight has turned autumn's natural decay into something grotesque and accelerated. At the center, a figure stands with arms raised not in celebration but in surrender, their shadow burned away to nothing beneath them. Their form appears to be gradually dissolving in the relentless exposure, features running like wax but still somehow conscious and aware of their dissolution."
      universal_symbol: "The magnifying glass - truth intensified beyond utility, detail that destroys the whole"
      mood: "Merciless intensity, the paralysis of too much awareness, beauty that destroys through its excess"

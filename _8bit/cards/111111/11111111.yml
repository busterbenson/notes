      card_name: "The Radiant Integrator"
      # 6 bits set to 1, so all archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral sage whose form seems to both embody and transcend light itself, appearing neither distinctly masculine nor feminine but rather as a perfect integration of all possible expressions. Their body seems composed of crystalline light structures that reflect and refract awareness in all directions simultaneously."
      question_posed: "Where in your life are you ready to integrate all perspectives and possibilities into a unified vision that excludes nothing yet maintains perfect clarity?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral sage sits in perfect meditation beneath a fruit-laden tree at the height of summer noon. Their form appears simultaneously solid and transparent, with skin that seems to contain fractal patterns that mirror both the cellular structure of the leaves above and the cosmic patterns of distant galaxies. Their eyes are multifaceted like a dragonfly's, suggesting the ability to perceive all perspectives simultaneously. Surrounding the sage is a perfectly arranged mandala of measuring instruments - sundials, prisms, lenses, and mirrors - each capturing light differently yet all working in harmonic resonance. The sage holds a geometric object that functions as both prism and seed, through which light passes and emerges as rainbow patterns that exactly match the veining in the leaves above and the root structure below. The summer sun directly overhead casts no harsh shadows but rather illuminates everything with perfect clarity, revealing the underlying patterns that connect all things. The sage's own shadow is not dark but translucent, revealing deeper dimensions beneath the visible world. Small creatures - butterflies, hummingbirds, bees - dance around the sage in patterns that trace out the golden ratio, neither drawn to nor repelled by the sage's presence but simply in perfect natural harmony with it."
      universal_symbol: "The fractal - a pattern that reveals whole systems within their smallest parts, perfect self-similarity across all scales"
      mood: "Transcendent understanding, enlightened perspective, the peace of complete integration"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral sage with crystalline skin sitting beneath a summer tree, holding a geometric object that functions as both prism and seed.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and white for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and golden accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11111111' and card title 'THE RADIANT INTEGRATOR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature multifaceted eyes, measuring instruments arranged in mandala form, rainbow light patterns, translucent shadow revealing patterns, and creatures tracing golden ratio patterns.
      The scene should evoke the mood of transcendent understanding and perfect integration, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

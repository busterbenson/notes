    desc: "This card represents the profound wisdom that emerges in the threshold state right before completion. It embodies the transcendent understanding of the final stages of a journey, when all elements are present but not yet fully integrated. In its Sage aspect, it reveals deep insight into the nature of preparation, transition, and the moment of potential realization."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Threshold Guardian"
      card_creature: "A sage with autumn-amber eyes who stands at the penultimate step, holding a crystalline vessel that's one drop short of overflowing"
      question_posed: "What final element or insight needs integration before your current journey can reach its culmination?"
      card_scene: "An ancient guardian figure stands on a stone threshold at the entrance to a circular temple, with one hand holding back the final golden-amber leaf of autumn from falling, keeping it suspended in perfect stillness. Behind them, a nearly-completed mosaic floor shows a complex pattern with only one piece missing – the piece is visible, hovering in the air above its destination. The sage's eyes reflect both the pattern as it currently exists and as it will be when complete. A waning moon hangs low in the sky, casting just enough light to illuminate the threshold's intricate markings. Around the temple, several hourglasses of different sizes all show nearly-depleted top chambers, with just a few grains yet to fall. The guardian wears robes embroidered with mathematical equations and alchemical formulas that seem to calculate the precise moment of completion. They hold a set of scales that's nearly but not quite in perfect balance, suggesting that the final adjustment is yet to come."
      universal_symbol: "The threshold – the space between what is and what will be, where transformation is imminent but not yet manifest"
      mood: "Anticipatory wisdom, contemplative patience, the profound understanding that comes at the edge of realization"

      # USE THIS PROMPT TEMPLATE BUT FILL IN WITH SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR THIS CARD:
      # Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short scene description].
      # Use [INNER WORLD COLOR] for foreground elements (inner world) and [OUTER WORLD COLOR] for background/environment (outer world), with [ACCENT COLOR] for highlights.
      # Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      # Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code "[XXXXXXXX]" and card title "[CARD TITLE]" in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      # Feature [key symbolic elements, e.g., moon phase, animal companions, symbolic object].
      # The scene should evoke the mood of [MOOD KEYWORDS] and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for [SEASON] (e.g., [Air/Winter], [Fire/Spring], [Water/Summer], [Earth/Fall]).
      # Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean.
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a sage standing at a temple threshold, holding back the final autumn leaf from falling while a nearly-complete mosaic awaits its last piece.
      Use CYAN for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and amber-gold accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '01010101' and card title 'THRESHOLD GUARDIAN' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon illuminating the scene, nearly-balanced scales, multiple hourglasses with few grains remaining, and mathematical equations embroidered on robes.
      The scene should evoke the mood of anticipatory wisdom and contemplative patience, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall (Earth/Fall symbols, the final moments of autumn before winter, the gathering of last elements before integration).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

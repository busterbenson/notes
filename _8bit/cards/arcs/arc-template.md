# Narrative Arc: [TYPE] [IDENTIFIER]

## Overview
[Brief introduction to this narrative arc and its significance in the 8-Bit Oracle system. Note that narrative arcs follow the sequence: Fool → Hero → Monster → Sage archetypes, which correspond to the seasons AFTER the resonant season. For example, if the resonant season is Spring, then the Fool archetype appears in Summer, the Hero in Fall, the Monster in Winter, and the Sage in Spring. This arc documents the transformative journey through each archetypal expression of the hexagram's energy.]

## Narrative Fable: [Title of the Fable]

It should embody the spiritual/psychological journey in narrative form and end with a sense of completion that suggests the beginning of a new cycle at a higher level. Aim for a fable that could stand alone as a teaching story while also illuminating the specific wisdom of this hexagram.]

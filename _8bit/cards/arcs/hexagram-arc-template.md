# Narrative Arc: [TYPE] [IDENTIFIER]

## Overview
[Brief introduction to this narrative arc and its significance in the 8-Bit Oracle system. Note that narrative arcs follow the sequence: Fool → Hero → Monster → Sage archetypes, which correspond to the seasons AFTER the resonant season. For example, if the resonant season is Spring, then the Fool archetype appears in Summer, the Hero in Fall, the Monster in Winter, and the Sage in Spring. This arc documents the transformative journey through each archetypal expression of the hexagram's energy.]

## Narrative Fable: [Title of the Fable]

[A short, evocative story that captures the entire arc in fable form. The fable should feature the central characters/elements from the cards and show their transformation through the four seasonal stages. It should embody the spiritual/psychological journey in narrative form and end with a sense of completion that suggests the beginning of a new cycle at a higher level. Aim for a fable that could stand alone as a teaching story while also illuminating the specific wisdom of this hexagram.]

## Core Theme
[The central narrative thread that connects all cards in this arc.]

## Internal Dramatic Tension
The arc of [Hexagram Name] explores three fundamental tensions that drive its narrative journey:

1. **[Primary Tension 1]**: [Describe the central tension/paradox that drives the arc's development. Explain how this tension evolves through the four archetypal stages, showing how each stage represents a different relationship to or expression of this tension. Example tensions include: Form vs. Formlessness, Unity vs. Diversity, Action vs. Receptivity, etc.]

2. **[Primary Tension 2]**: [Describe the second key tension that shapes character development through the arc. Explain how this tension manifests differently in each archetypal stage, creating challenges and growth opportunities. Example tensions include: Individual vs. Collective, Certainty vs. Uncertainty, Preservation vs. Transformation, etc.]

3. **[Primary Tension 3]**: [Describe the third tension that represents the fundamental transformation between beginning and end of the cycle. This tension usually involves how the character's relationship to reality itself transforms. Example tensions include: Separation vs. Integration, Control vs. Surrender, Knowledge vs. Wisdom, etc.]

## Relational Tensions
The [Hexagram Name] ([BINARY CODE]) exists in dynamic relationship with several other hexagrams, particularly its opposite, [Opposite Hexagram Name] ([OPPOSITE BINARY CODE]). These relationships reveal essential complementary tensions that add depth to its meaning within the 8-Bit Oracle system:

1. **[Hexagram Name] vs. [Opposite Hexagram Name]**: [Describe how this hexagram and its opposite represent complementary or contrasting energies. Explain what fundamental polarity or spectrum they represent together, and how they might interact in readings. For example, how Heaven (111111) and Earth (000000) represent complementary creative and receptive forces.]

2. **[Tension Aspect 1]**: [Describe a specific aspect of the relationship between this hexagram and its opposite, focusing on how they represent different approaches to a similar theme or challenge. For example, how The Creative emphasizes visibility while The Receptive emphasizes hiddenness.]

3. **[Tension Aspect 2]**: [Describe another aspect of the relationship, such as how the inner and outer trigrams are arranged differently and what this means. For example, how After Completion features Fire/Water while Before Completion features Water/Fire.]

4. **Relationship with [Related Hexagram 1] and [Related Hexagram 2]**: [Describe how this hexagram relates to 1-2 other hexagrams that share important connections or form meaningful patterns together. Explain what larger process or cycle they collectively represent. For example, how Return, After Completion, and Innocence might form a meta-cycle of consciousness development.]

## Evolutionary Journey

      card_name: "First Resonance"
      card_creature: "A wide-eyed female child discovering her authentic voice for the first time, creating ripples in the world around her as fallen leaves arrange themselves in patterns matching her song, unaware of the profound harmony she naturally creates"
      question_posed: "Where might you rediscover the simple joy of being authentically yourself without calculation or fear?"
      card_scene: "A young girl sits in a clearing of an autumn forest at dusk, singing a simple melody that seems to emerge from her without effort or training. Unlike the female sage's conscious mastery of resonance, the child creates harmony through innocent self-expression. As she sings, fallen leaves begin to arrange themselves in perfect wave patterns that match the frequency of her voice, creating visible sound waves on the forest floor. The girl notices this with delight but doesn't understand the phenomenon – she simply enjoys the magical response of the world to her authentic expression. A waning moon hangs low in the sky, its light creating a silver path through the forest that seems to vibrate slightly with her song. The autumn landscape enters into conversation with her voice – trees gently sway, small animals pause to listen, and even the clouds overhead seem to form patterns that echo her melody. The child holds a simple handmade instrument – perhaps a reed flute or small drum – that she plays without technique but with complete absorption. Though the sounds are simple, they create complex harmonics that spread through the forest. Nearby, a small pond captures her song in perfect ripples that create standing wave patterns. Several objects around her – pinecones, rocks, branches – have been arranged in spirals and patterns that intuitively follow sacred geometry, though she couldn't name these principles. Other children can be seen at the edges of the clearing, drawn by the resonance she creates, some beginning to hum along or tap rhythms that complement her melody. The child's expression shows pure joy in self-expression without self-consciousness – the discovery that being authentically oneself creates natural harmony with the world. Small symbols of different scales appear throughout the scene – a DNA helix in a dewdrop, crystal lattices forming in freezing puddles, birds flying in formation – all showing the same pattern as her song, suggesting that she has inadvertently found a fundamental frequency of nature itself."
      universal_symbol: "The first melody – the innocent song that naturally finds harmony with the world around it, representing how authentic self-expression creates effortless resonance"
      mood: "Innocent wonder, playful discovery, the effortless harmony that emerges when authentic self-expression meets receptive environment"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a young girl sitting in an autumn forest clearing at dusk, singing a simple melody that causes fallen leaves to arrange themselves in perfect wave patterns matching the frequency of her voice.
      Use YELLOW for foreground elements (inner world) and CYAN for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and warm amber accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11001101' and card title 'FIRST RESONANCE' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon low in the sky, sound wave patterns visible in arrangements of leaves, animals pausing to listen, and the same resonant pattern appearing at different scales (ripples in water, arrangement of clouds, flight patterns of birds).
      The scene should evoke the mood of innocent wonder and playful discovery, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall (Earth/Fall symbols, autumn leaves, the grounding quality of earth receiving sound vibrations).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the child as a young girl, with feminine features and an expression of wonder and delight."

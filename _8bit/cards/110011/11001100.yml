      card_creature: "A masterful male craftsman whose hands work with perfect precision, creating instruments that reveal the resonant frequency of all they touch, his entire being aligned in the service of bringing inner truth into physical form"
      question_posed: "Where might your authentic self-expression become a transformative force through skilled action?"
      card_scene: "A focused male craftsman works in a winter forge, the outside world crystalline with ice and snow while his workspace resonates with the precise sounds of his craft. Unlike the female sage's serene contemplation or the female child's innocent discovery, this man actively embodies truth through skilled action and applied mastery. His hands work with extraordinary precision on what appears to be a tuning instrument of unprecedented design – perhaps a tuning fork, bell, or stringed device – that will reveal the resonant frequency of anything it touches. The darkness outside is illuminated only by starlight and a thin crescent moon, with the forge itself creating a pocket of warmth and focused energy within the winter landscape. The craftsman's expression shows neither the detachment of wisdom nor the naivety of wonder, but rather the complete absorption of mastery – where authentic action flows without separation between doer and deed. Around the forge, various materials are arranged with perfect order – metals of different compositions, crystals of precise geometries, tools carefully calibrated – each selected for their acoustic properties. When struck or activated, they create harmonic overtones that seem to reveal their essential nature. Ice crystals form on the edges of the workshop windows, growing in patterns that precisely match the harmonic frequencies being produced inside – as if the sound waves themselves are organizing matter. The objects being crafted appear deceptively simple, yet contain sophisticated principles of resonance, harmonics, and wave propagation that the craftsman understands intuitively through years of dedicated practice. Apprentices watch from a respectful distance, attempting to mimic his techniques but unable to match the integrity of his approach – not because they lack skill, but because his work emerges from complete authenticity rather than mere technique. Various fields of resonant patterns are visible throughout the scene – sound waves in the air, harmonics in metal, crystal structures, architectural acoustics – all showing how the same patterns of truth manifest at different scales and in different materials. The entire scene conveys the transformative power that emerges when inner authenticity becomes embodied in skilled action – how truth becomes a transformative force in the world when expressed through mastery."
      universal_symbol: "The resonant instrument – the tool that both detects and creates perfect harmony, representing how embodied authenticity transforms the material world"
      mood: "Embodied mastery, resonant action, the transformative power that emerges when inner truth manifests through skilled performance and confident expertise"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a focused male craftsman working in a winter forge, crafting a sophisticated tuning instrument with extraordinary precision, his entire workspace organized around principles of acoustic resonance.
      Use YELLOW for foreground elements (inner world) and CYAN for background/environment (outer world), with turquoise and crisp white accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11001100' and card title 'TRUTH IN ACTION' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a new moon visible through window, ice crystals forming in resonant patterns, various metals and materials arranged in precise order, and apprentices watching the master's technique from a distance.
      The scene should evoke the mood of embodied mastery and resonant action, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter (Air/Winter symbols, the way sound travels purely in cold air, the crystalline clarity of winter's acoustic properties).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the craftsman as masculine, with strong features and an expression of focused determination."

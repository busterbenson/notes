  cycle_position: Fourth Season
  cycle_description: A Fall expression of a Winter-resonant pattern
  detailed_description: The Fool represents innocence, new beginnings, and fresh perspectives.
    It appears when a card's resonant season is followed by its cycle bits' season.
    The Fool archetype embodies potential and untested energy, where the card's pattern
    is moving into a new phase with openness and curiosity. The fool manifests in
    cards as characters in childhood or at the threshold of a journey. In the narrative
    cycle, the Fool is always the beginning point - the awakening of consciousness
    to new possibilities. In the Gene Key associations (found in core-systems.yml
    and gene-keys-reference.md), the Fool is associated with the gene key's raw potential,
    outside of the more specific nuances of the shadow, gift, and siddhi.

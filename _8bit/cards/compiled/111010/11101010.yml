  current_season: Spring
  color: Iridescent
  gene_key_aspect: siddhi
  gene_key_manifestation: Timelessness
  expression: The integrated, wise expression of Timelessness - the culmination of
    this energy pattern
  cycle_position: Resonant Season
  cycle_description: A Spring expression of a Spring-resonant pattern
  detailed_description: The Sage represents a collective state of wisdom, integration,
    and harmony between its energy's strengths AND acceptance and accountability for
    its shadow, across individuals and time. It appears when a card's resonant season
    matches its cycle bits' season. The Sage archetype embodies the most balanced
    expression of the card's energy, where inner and outer worlds are appropriately
    aligned with the cycle phase. The sage manifests in cards as multifaceted and
    chimeric in nature (a union of several characters/creatures/groups), whole in
    time more than space, because they integrate cycles of change and growth. In the
    narrative cycle, the Sage follows the Monster, representing the integration and
    transcendence phase of consciousness. The Sage contains the wisdom of the entire
    cycle and ultimately transcends it to become a new kind of Fool at a higher level.
    In the Gene Key associations (found in core-systems.yml and gene-keys-reference.md),
    the Sage is associated with the siddhi version of the gene key that is associated
    with the card in question.

  cycle_description: A Winter expression of a Spring-resonant pattern
  detailed_description: 'The Monster represents the seed of the hero''s shadow realized:
    the resultant excess, challenges caused by the solutions of the past, and shadow
    aspects that the hero didn''t want to confront. It appears when a card''s resonant
    season is three steps ahead of (or one step behind) its cycle bits'' season. The
    Monster archetype embodies the imbalanced or exaggerated expression of the card''s
    qualities, where energy has become distorted or overwhelming. The monster will
    often manifest in cards as an animal/creature/monster that represents the shadow
    of the hero it''s related to. In the narrative cycle, the Monster follows the
    Hero, representing the challenge and transformation phase of consciousness. In
    the Gene Key associations (found in core-systems.yml and gene-keys-reference.md),
    the Monster is associated with the shadow version of the gene key that is associated
    with the card in question.'

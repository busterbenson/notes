  resonant_season_key: inner0-outer1
  resonant_season: Fall

  color: Gold
  gene_key_aspect: gift
  gene_key_manifestation: Discrimination
  expression: The skilled, masterful expression of Discrimination - this energy pattern
    at its most effective
  cycle_position: Third Season
  cycle_description: A Spring expression of a Fall-resonant pattern
  detailed_description: The Hero represents skill, mastery, and accomplished power.
    It appears when a card's resonant season is two steps ahead of its cycle bits'
    season. The Hero archetype embodies competence and achievement, where the card's
    pattern has matured and developed strong capabilities, and yet also has the seed
    of its own shadow. The hero will often manifest in cards as the peak form of an
    individual human character, but usually as a snapshot in time that will inevitably
    change and lose that moment of perfection. In the narrative cycle, the Hero follows
    the Fool, representing the development and mastery phase of consciousness. In
    the Gene Key associations (found in core-systems.yml and gene-keys-reference.md),
    the Hero is associated with the gift version of the gene key that is associated
    with the card in question.

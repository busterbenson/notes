    # Oracle card creation - captures the essence of all 8 bits and associations
    # Follow style guidelines for consistent deck creation
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "[Evocative name for the card]"
      card_creature: "[Description of the mythological figure or character that embodies this card's energy, with correct gender terms based on bit count]"
      question_posed: "[Question this card asks the querent - should prompt reflection about the core themes]"

      universal_symbol: "[Core symbol that captures the essence of this card - should be distinctive and memorable]"
      mood: "[Emotional/energetic quality of the card - what feeling does it evoke?]"

      # Image generation prompt - use this template but fill with specific details
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short scene description].
      Use [INNER WORLD COLOR] for foreground elements (inner world) and [OUTER WORLD COLOR] for background/environment (outer world), with [ARCHETYPE COLOR] highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, centered, with a card title '[CARD TITLE]' in bold and a more subtle subtitle below that with the 8-bit code '[XXXXXXXX]' and , without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature [card_creature in the card_scene, key symbolic elements, e.g., moon phase, animal companions, symbolic object].
      The scene should evoke the mood of [MOOD KEYWORDS] and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for [SEASON].
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

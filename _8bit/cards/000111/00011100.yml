    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Curious Blockage"
      card_creature: "A child explorer who encounters a massive wall of ice and instead of feeling frustrated, begins to study its patterns with wonder, discovering tiny ecosystems within the frozen barrier"
      question_posed: "What might you discover if you approached your current obstacle with innocent curiosity rather than frustration?"
      card_scene: "A young child stands before an enormous wall of ice in a winter landscape. Their eyes are wide with fascination rather than disappointment as they examine the intricate frost patterns that have formed across the barrier. A new moon is barely visible in the night sky, offering just enough light to illuminate the scene. The child carries numerous tools and resources in a backpack that seems almost too large - maps, compasses, climbing gear - yet stands perfectly still, more interested in the beauty of the obstruction than in finding a way past it. Their breath creates small clouds in the frigid air as they trace patterns on the ice with a mittened finger. Behind them, their footprints in the snow form a winding, exploratory path rather than a direct line, suggesting they've been playfully wandering. The barrier itself contains frozen insects, plants, and air bubbles that create miniature worlds within the ice. A boundary stone marking the edge of a territory is completely encased in frost, transforming it into a sculpture of crystalline beauty. The child's body appears hollow or translucent, contrasting with the solid, resource-rich environment around them. Near their feet, a frozen river meets the ice dam, and the child has begun to create a small snow sculpture mirroring the larger obstruction, playing with the concept rather than fighting against it."
      universal_symbol: "The ice wall â€“ seemingly impenetrable barrier that reveals hidden beauty and knowledge when examined closely rather than struggled against"
      mood: "Innocent wonder, childlike curiosity, the fresh perspective that emerges when obstacles are approached without preconceptions or frustration"

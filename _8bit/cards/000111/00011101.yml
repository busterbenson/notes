    desc: "This card represents the profound wisdom that emerges when we fully accept and understand periods of stagnation.

In its Sage aspect, it reveals the deep insights that can only be accessed through patient observation of apparent standstill."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Insight of Stillness"
      card_creature: "An elder observer whose eyes have seen countless rivers meet dams, whose hands rest perfectly still on a boundary stone that marks where movement must cease"
      question_posed: "What wisdom might emerge if you fully accept and explore your current state of stagnation rather than struggling against it?"
      card_scene: "An ancient sage sits perfectly still beside a blocked mountain pass in autumn. Before them, fallen leaves have arranged themselves in a perfect mandala pattern, having come to rest against an immovable stone barrier. A waning moon casts just enough light to illuminate the scene, its reflection perfectly undisturbed in a small pond nearby. The sage's eyes show neither frustration nor impatience, but rather profound understanding – as if the blockage itself contains secret knowledge. Their body appears empty, almost translucent, while the world around them teems with abundant resources and possibilities that cannot be accessed. At their feet lies a map showing many pathways, all currently obstructed. Their hands rest on a boundary stone carved with symbols of limitation from many cultures. Animals have gathered nearby, also motionless, as if learning from the sage's acceptance of standstill. The sage wears simple robes adorned with symbols of patience, and their expression suggests they've discovered something valuable precisely because movement has ceased."
      universal_symbol: "The dam – the point where abundant flow meets complete stoppage, creating depth through restriction"
      mood: "Profound acceptance, enlightened patience, the transcendent understanding that comes when one fully embraces necessary stagnation"

# 8-Bit Oracle Card Generation Tools

This directory contains tools for generating 8-Bit Oracle cards based on binary codes.

## Overview

The 8-Bit Oracle is a binary-based system for divination and self-reflection. Each card is represented by an 8-bit binary code (e.g., `10101010`).

- The first 6 bits (`xxxxxx__`) represent the hexagram (inner and outer resources)
- The last 2 bits (`______xx`) represent the season (Winter=00, Spring=10, Summer=11, Fall=01)

## Streamlined Card Generation Workflow

1. **Generate a card with the template structure**:
   ```bash
   ./generate-card.sh 10101010
   ```
   Creates a complete YAML file at `generated/10101010.yml`

2. **Create narrative arc** (if not already existing):
   - Create or edit a narrative arc file in `arcs/hexagram/<6-bit-code>.md`
   - This provides consistent storytelling across the 4 seasonal cards

3. **Fill in card details**:
   - Edit the generated YAML to replace placeholder fields
   - Add keywords, symbols, and detailed descriptions
   - Complete the image prompt section

4. **Generate card image**:
   - Use the completed image prompt with an image generation service
   - Save the resulting image to `card_images/`

## Scripts

### Generate a Single Card

To generate a single card:

```bash
./generate-card.sh <binary_code>
```

Example:

```bash
./generate-card.sh 10101010
```

This will create a YAML file for the card in the `generated/` directory.

### Generate All Cards for a Hexagram

To generate all four seasonal variations for a specific hexagram:

```bash
./generate-hexagram.sh <6-bit_code>
```

Example:

```bash
./generate-hexagram.sh 101010
```

This will create four YAML files (one for each season) in the `generated/` directory.

## Generated Card Files

The generated card files contain:

- Basic information (binary code, decimal, hexadecimal)
- Direct associations (archetype, gender, colors, trigrams, etc.)
- Interpreted meanings (card name, description, imagery)
- Related cards (same hexagram in different seasons, opposites)
- Bit values and fractal meanings

## Directory Structure

- `generate-card.py` - Python script for generating a single card
- `generate-card.sh` - Shell wrapper for the Python script
- `generate-hexagram.sh` - Shell script to generate all four seasonal cards for a hexagram
- `generated/` - Directory containing generated card files
- `compiled/` - Directory containing raw association data (generated by association-generator.py)
- `card-template.yml` - Template for card structure
- `arcs/` - Directory containing narrative arcs for hexagrams
- `archived_scripts/` - Directory containing older scripts that have been replaced by newer versions

## Dependencies

These scripts rely on several reference files:

- `../associations/core-systems.yml` - Core bit definitions and meanings
- `../associations/composite-associations.yml` - Combined frameworks
- `../associations/lunar-cycle.yml` - Lunar phase information
- `../associations/gender-assignment.md` - Gender assignment rules

## Card Attributes

Key attributes of each card include:

- **Archetype**: Sage, Fool, Hero, or Monster (based on the relationship between resonant season and card season)
- **Gender**: Masculine, feminine, or neutral (based on bit count)
- **Inner World**: Meaning derived from bits 1-3
- **Outer World**: Meaning derived from bits 4-6
- **Season**: Derived from bits 7-8
- **Lunar Phase**: Calculated based on decimal value

## Example Usage

```bash
# Generate the Void Mirror card (00000000)
./generate-card.sh 00000000

# Generate all four seasonal variations of hexagram 000000
./generate-hexagram.sh 000000

# Generate all cards for a random hexagram
RANDOM_HEX=$(python -c "import random; print(''.join([str(random.randint(0, 1)) for _ in range(6)]))")
./generate-hexagram.sh $RANDOM_HEX
```

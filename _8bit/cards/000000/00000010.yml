    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, the mythology of Hilda, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.

      card_name: "Unwritten Beginning"
      card_creature: "A moon-pale child with curious eyes that reflect starlight even where there are no stars"
      question_posed: "What might emerge if you step into darkness without assuming it's something to fear?"
      card_scene: "A child with luminous skin stands at the edge of an undefined void, their posture suggesting eager curiosity rather than hesitation. Spring's first green shoots break through dark soil around their feet, with tiny sprouts reaching toward the darkness rather than away from it. Above, a waxing moon provides just enough light to see the child's wide, wondering eyes and reaching hands. The child holds a simple magnifying glass, using it not to illuminate but to better examine the textures of shadow. Their shadow, cast by the waxing moon, appears to have a life of its own, forming new shapes that the child doesn't notice but that suggest growth and possibility."
      universal_symbol: "The empty circle - potential before form, the space that precedes creation"
      mood: "Innocent curiosity, threshold anticipation, the peculiar silence before first words"

    desc: "The Receptive Hero represents masterful yielding and strategic receptivity. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 2 (Kun/The Receptive) expressed through Summer's qualities of abundance and fulfillment. As the Hero in the cycle, this figure approaches receptivity as a skill to be mastered, cultivating the power of perfect response. With no inner or outer resources activated but acting within Summer's vibrant energy, there is a paradoxical strength in complete surrender. The heroism comes from transforming receptivity into a form of power."

      card_name: "The Perfect Vessel"
      # 0 bits set to 1, so all archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral warrior-sage whose power comes not from force but from perfect receptivity. Their body has been trained to absolute stillness and response, able to receive and redirect any energy without resistance. Neither distinctly masculine nor feminine, they embody the heroic aspect of yielding."
      question_posed: "What situation in your life requires the strength to receive completely rather than to act or resist?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands in a summer lake under the full moon, their body poised in perfect balance. Their clothing is minimal – loose garments that flow with the water rather than resist it. Around them, the water mirrors the night sky so perfectly that the boundary between above and below seems to vanish, suggesting infinite depth in both directions. The figure holds their hands cupped to form a perfect vessel, which somehow manages to collect both water from below and moonlight from above. Their expression shows intense concentration, suggesting that this receptivity requires great skill rather than passivity. Surrounding the lake, summer flowers are in full bloom, their cups open to the night. In the background stands an empty throne carved from stone, suggesting that true power rests in the ability to remain unfilled and receptive. The figure's body casts no shadow, as if they have become so receptive that they no longer disrupt the flow of light and energy around them."
      universal_symbol: "A perfect, empty vessel that can receive anything without being changed or diminished by it"
      mood: "Poised receptivity, strategic stillness, balanced power"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral figure standing in a lake under the full moon, hands cupped to form a vessel.
      Use black for foreground elements (inner world) and black for background/environment (outer world), with gold and deep blue accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000011' and card title 'THE PERFECT VESSEL' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a perfect mirror reflection of sky in water, full moon, blooming summer flowers, and an empty stone throne.
      The scene should evoke the mood of poised receptivity and balanced power, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

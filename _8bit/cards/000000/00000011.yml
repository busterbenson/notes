    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, the mythology of Hilda, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck.

      card_name: "Torchbearer"
      card_creature: "A determined night explorer with eyes adjusted to darkness, carrying tools for mapping what cannot be fully seen"
      question_posed: "How might you move confidently through uncertainty, using the absence of clarity as a space for directed creation?"
      card_scene: "A figure in exploration gear moves purposefully through darkness, their face showing determined concentration rather than fear. They hold a specially designed torch that casts focused, directional light rather than diffuse illumination. In their other hand, they carry precise navigational instruments - a star chart, compass, and measuring tools designed specifically for dark terrain. A full moon shines through summer leaves overhead, its light creating distinctive shadow patterns that seem to form a map on the ground. The explorer is carefully adding to a partially completed chart, drawing the contours of darkness itself with confident strokes. Their footprints behind them glow slightly, marking a clear path for others to follow."
      universal_symbol: "The torch - directed illumination that doesn't dispel mystery but allows navigation through it"
      mood: "Purposeful exploration, masterful navigation, confident charting of the unknown"

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Void Wisdom"
      card_creature: "An ancient sage whose eyes reflect the darkness between stars and whose hands shape emptiness into form"
      question_posed: "What insights emerge when you embrace uncertainty not as something to overcome but as the very ground of wisdom itself?"
      card_scene: "An elderly sage sits in deep meditation upon pristine snow, the darkness of winter night surrounding them. Their eyes are closed, but a third eye on their forehead is open, revealing a miniature cosmos within. Their hands form a mudra that creates the perfect outline of emptiness in the air before them. Within this shaped void, subtle patterns emerge and dissolve - galaxies, seeds, mathematical equations. Above, a new moon forms a perfect empty circle in the sky. The sage's breath is visible in the cold air, but rather than dispersing, it forms crystalline geometric patterns that hang suspended. A dark mirror or pool beside them reflects nothing visible yet seems profoundly full."
      universal_symbol: "The empty bowl - receptive wisdom that holds without grasping"
      mood: "Transcendent understanding, profound acceptance, the peace of embracing mystery"

      # USE THIS PROMPT TEMPLATE BUT FILL IN WITH SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR THIS CARD:
      # Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short scene description].
      # Use [INNER WORLD COLOR] for foreground elements (inner world) and [OUTER WORLD COLOR] for background/environment (outer world), with [ACCENT COLOR] for highlights.
      # Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      # Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code "[XXXXXXXX]" and card title "[CARD TITLE]" in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      # Feature [key symbolic elements, e.g., moon phase, animal companions, symbolic object].

      # Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean.
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of an ancient sage meditating in winter night, forming a mudra that shapes emptiness.
      Use BLACK for foreground elements (inner world) and BLACK for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and crystalline blue accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000000' and card title 'VOID WISDOM' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a new moon as empty circle, third eye revealing cosmic patterns, geometric breath patterns crystallizing in cold air, and an empty bowl or dark mirror nearby.
      The scene should evoke the mood of transcendent understanding and profound acceptance, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter (Air/Winter symbols, crystalline patterns, sacred geometry in snow and ice).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

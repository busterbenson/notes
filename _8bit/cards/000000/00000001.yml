    desc: "The Receptive Monster represents receptivity distorted to the extreme of absolute consumption. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 2 (Kun/The Receptive) twisted by Fall's qualities of decay and release, creating a figure whose yielding has become a devouring void. As the Monster in the cycle, this figure embodies what happens when receptivity becomes excessive - a black hole that consumes without discrimination or boundary. With no inner or outer resources activated but merged with Fall's energy of release and letting go, there is a terrifying emptiness that absorbs everything without being filled."

    oracle_card:
      card_name: "The Consuming Void"
      # 0 bits set to 1, so all archetypes are gender-neutral
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral entity with a form that seems to bend reality inward toward itself, neither clearly masculine nor feminine but rather an absence that hungers. Their body appears to be composed of nothing yet somehow absorbs everything around it, a paradoxical embodiment of emptiness that consumes."
      question_posed: "Where in your life has receptivity become excessive, creating a void that consumes without discrimination or satisfaction?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure stands in an autumn forest, but their form is distorted – not solid but rather like a tear in reality that pulls everything toward it. Their body appears as a silhouette of absolute emptiness that somehow has depth, drawing in the falling leaves, mist, and even light itself. The waning moon above seems to be slowly sinking toward this figure, as if being pulled in as well. Around the entity, trees appear warped, their trunks and branches bending toward the figure regardless of wind direction. The ground beneath has formed a subtle spiral pattern of fallen leaves, creating the impression of a whirlpool with the figure at its center. Small objects – stones, twigs, bits of bark – float upward from the ground toward the entity rather than falling naturally. The figure's eyes are visible only as deeper voids within the general emptiness of their form, and they hold out what might be hands, though they appear more like tears in the fabric of reality – openings into a place of absolute emptiness that somehow remains eternally hungry."
      universal_symbol: "A black hole, consuming everything without ever being filled"
      mood: "Insatiable emptiness, boundaryless consumption, terrifying absorption"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a void-like gender-neutral figure in an autumn forest pulling everything toward itself.
      Use black for foreground elements (inner world) and black for background/environment (outer world), with deep purple and rusty orange accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000001' and card title 'THE CONSUMING VOID' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon being pulled downward, trees bending toward the figure, a spiral pattern of fallen leaves, and objects floating upward against gravity.
      The scene should evoke the mood of insatiable emptiness and terrifying absorption, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

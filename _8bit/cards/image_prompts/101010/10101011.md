LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "THRESHOLD OF KNOWING" (10101011)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that embodies the essence of "Curiosity awakens beyond certain knowledge" - capturing the spirit of the THRESHOLD OF KNOWING card from the 8-Bit Oracle.

IMPORTANT: This Summer card must represent a DRAMATICALLY DISTINCT SCENE from the other seasonal cards in hexagram 101010. It is not merely a variation of the same visual theme but a fundamentally different moment in the narrative journey. Ensure that the character, environment, and symbolic elements all show clear transformation appropriate to this specific stage.

## ARCHETYPE INTEGRATION (Fool Archetype)
This card must fully embody the Fool archetype in all visual and thematic elements:
- **Character Energy:** The character should fully express the qualities of curious, playful, innocent, spontaneous, unpredictable, naive
- **Environmental Resonance:** The setting must reflect newness, possibility, undefined boundaries
- **Visual Language:** Use asymmetrical composition, dynamic movement, unexpected elements in the composition
- **Symbolic Expression:** Include symbols that express emergence, potential, beginnings, spiral/helix motifs
- **Time Quality:** Capture a moment that feels like dawn/beginning, first moment, initial awakening, spark of awareness

## CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition
- No decorative borders or frames - allow natural margins (5-8% of width)
- Bottom 15% (plus bottom margin) reserved for title bar with horizontal line separation

## MARGIN GUIDELINES:
- The entire illustration must be enclosed by a uniform visual margin on all four sides.
- Use a consistent 90-pixel margin (7.5% of width and height) from the canvas edge on top, bottom, left, and right.
- All elements — including background textures, gradients, shapes, and shadows — must remain fully within this margin boundary. Nothing may touch or bleed off the edge
- The top and bottom margins must be exactly the same size as the left and right margins.
- This includes the title bar: ensure that it sits above the bottom margin and does not touch the bottom edge.
- Think of the illustration as placed within a rigid rectangular matte — everything inside should feel balanced, centered, and framed.
- The entire card should evoke stillness and containment — a portal to a quiet space, not an image trying to escape its own skin.

## TITLE BAR INSTRUCTIONS:
- The bottom 15% of the image height (300px) is reserved for the title bar
- The title bar should be clearly separated from the main image by a horizontal line or natural visual break
- Maintain a 5–8% margin from the actual bottom edge of the canvas — the title bar should not touch the edge
- Inside the title bar:
  - Title in all caps: "THRESHOLD OF KNOWING", centered and bold
  - Subtitle directly below: "10101011", smaller, also centered
  - Used slashed zeros (like 0̸) instead of unslashed 0s when printing binary codes
  - Use lighter stroke fonts for the subtitle to create contrast with the heavier title

## TYPOGRAPHY & FONT GUIDANCE:
The typography should reflect the Fool archetype:
- **Title Font Style**: Slightly playful sans serif with organic qualities
- **Characteristics**: Rounded terminals, subtle variations in stroke, balanced but not rigid
- **Emotional Quality**: Curiosity, potential, openness, freshness
- **Similar To**: Similar to Gill Sans, Open Sans, or humanist sans-serif typefaces
- **Font Size:** The binary code is visually smaller than the title — the title uses large lettering; the binary code is in a much smaller type directly underneath with generous space between.

### Font Size & Spacing Specifications:
- **Title**: 
  - Size: 32-36px (adjust slightly smaller for longer titles)
  - Weight: Bold
  - Case: All uppercase
  - Letter-spacing: 0.1em
  - Position: Centered, 120px from bottom edge of card
  
- **Binary Code**: 
  - Size: 18-20px
  - Weight: Regular
  - Case: As shown
  - Letter-spacing: 0.05em
  - Position: Centered, 14px below title
  - Use slashed zeros (0̸) for clarity
  - Use a diagonal line through each zero in the binary code to distinguish them
  
- **Title/Subtitle Relationship**:
  - The title and binary code should feel like a cohesive unit
  - Maintain consistent positioning across all cards in the deck
  - Allow 14px vertical space between title and binary code

## COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Magenta (for inner world elements - the Fox)
- Secondary: Green (for outer world environment - the Forest)
- Accent: Turquoise (for highlights and key symbolic elements)
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Black for outlines and details with varying line weights

## KEY SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Bubbling cauldron with shifting patterns
- Playful russet fox with bright eyes
- Forest clearing dappled with sunlight
- Scattered leaves and berries around the vessel

## FULL VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
Summer sunlight pours through a vibrant forest canopy, creating a dazzling mosaic of light and shadow in a secluded clearing. At the center stands a copper cauldron, its ancient metal warm with reflected light, now actively bubbling with mysterious liquid. The surface of the mixture shifts continuously—gold to silver to crystal and back—never settling into a fixed pattern.

A young russet fox circles the cauldron with boundless energy, occasionally leaping up to peer inside before darting away again. Her bright amber eyes reflect the same curious intensity as the bubbling mixture. With each excited circle, the fox deliberately drops forest treasures into the cauldron—a vibrant leaf, a plump berry, a dewdrop from a spider's web—each addition causing new patterns to ripple across the surface.

Steam rises from the cauldron in ephemeral shapes that almost form recognizable symbols before dissolving back into the air. The fox pauses occasionally, head tilted, as if hearing questions in the bubbling sounds. All around, the forest seems unusually attentive, leaves turning toward the clearing, birds perching closer than normal, watching the playful experiment unfold at this threshold where certainty dissolves into the joy of not-knowing.

## SEASONAL NARRATIVE COHERENCE:
This card is part of a four-card seasonal cycle for hexagram 101010. Maintain visual and symbolic coherence across this cycle:

- **Winter (10101000)**: "Questioning Mastery" - snow-covered cauldron with pulsing rhythms, silver-streaked fox with penetrating gaze
- **Spring (10101010)**: "Doubtless Mirror" - perfectly still cauldron with reflective surface, silver-furred fox with luminous eyes
- **Summer (10101011)**: "Threshold of Knowing" - actively bubbling cauldron with shifting patterns, playful russet fox with bright eyes
- **Fall (10101001)**: "Inquiry's Vessel" - intensely bubbling cauldron with complex patterns, focused fox with watchful stance

As the Summer expression of this hexagram, this card represents the first awakening in the journey of After Completion, where accomplishment transforms into fresh questioning. The central motif (the cauldron) should appear actively bubbling under the summer sun as the fox adds different forest elements.

## CHARACTER & SCENE INTEGRATION:
The illustration should harmoniously blend the following aspects:
- Fool archetype with Fox/Forest quality
- Summer atmosphere with Water element influences
- After Completion energy (hexagram 101010)
- Initial Potential of Doubt→Inquiry→Truth

## MOOD AND ESSENCE:
The image should convey: Curiosity awakens beyond certain knowledge

## LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "THRESHOLD OF KNOWING" in bold, centered, all caps
- "10101011" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling space above title bar with strong compositional flow

This card represents the moment where the young fox first approaches the abandoned cauldron and begins playful experimentation, marking the threshold where fixed knowledge opens to new questions.

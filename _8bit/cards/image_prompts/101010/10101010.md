LIMITED COLOR RISOGRAPH-STYLE ILLUSTRATION FOR "DOUBTLESS MIRROR" (10101010)

Create a limited-color risograph-style illustration that embodies the essence of "Truth beyond questions, knowingness in reflection" - capturing the spirit of the DOUBTLESS MIRROR card from the 8-Bit Oracle.

IMPORTANT: This Spring card must represent a DRAMATICALLY DISTINCT SCENE from the other seasonal cards in hexagram 101010. It is not merely a variation of the same visual theme but a fundamentally different moment in the narrative journey. Ensure that the character, environment, and symbolic elements all show clear transformation appropriate to this specific stage.

## ARCHETYPE INTEGRATION (Sage Archetype)
This card must fully embody the Sage archetype in all visual and thematic elements:
- **Character Energy:** The character should fully express the qualities of wise, still, observant, profound, integrated, transcendent
- **Environmental Resonance:** The setting must reflect wisdom, timelessness, integration of opposites
- **Visual Language:** Use symmetrical composition, central positioning, balanced elements in the composition
- **Symbolic Expression:** Include symbols that express completion, wholeness, transcendence, circle/sphere motifs
- **Time Quality:** Capture a moment that feels like timeless, eternal moment, beyond sequential time

## CARD DIMENSIONS AND STYLE:
- 1200 x 2000 pixels (3:5 ratio)
- Woodblock print/risograph aesthetic with bold lines and limited colors
- Strong contrast between elements with minimalist composition
- No decorative borders or frames - allow natural margins (5-8% of width)
- Bottom 15% (plus bottom margin) reserved for title bar with horizontal line separation

## MARGIN GUIDELINES:
- The entire illustration must be enclosed by a uniform visual margin on all four sides.
- Use a consistent 90-pixel margin (7.5% of width and height) from the canvas edge on top, bottom, left, and right.
- All elements — including background textures, gradients, shapes, and shadows — must remain fully within this margin boundary. Nothing may touch or bleed off the edge
- The top and bottom margins must be exactly the same size as the left and right margins.
- This includes the title bar: ensure that it sits above the bottom margin and does not touch the bottom edge.
- Think of the illustration as placed within a rigid rectangular matte — everything inside should feel balanced, centered, and framed.
- The entire card should evoke stillness and containment — a portal to a quiet space, not an image trying to escape its own skin.

## TITLE BAR INSTRUCTIONS:
- The bottom 15% of the image height (300px) is reserved for the title bar
- The title bar should be clearly separated from the main image by a horizontal line or natural visual break
- Maintain a 5–8% margin from the actual bottom edge of the canvas — the title bar should not touch the edge
- Inside the title bar:
  - Title in all caps: "DOUBTLESS MIRROR", centered and bold
  - Subtitle directly below: "10101010", smaller, also centered
  - Used slashed zeros (like 0̸) instead of unslashed 0s when printing binary codes
  - Use lighter stroke fonts for the subtitle to create contrast with the heavier title

## TYPOGRAPHY & FONT GUIDANCE:
The typography should reflect the Sage archetype:
- **Title Font Style**: Serene, classic serif font with timeless qualities
- **Characteristics**: Even stroke width, balanced proportions, classic letterforms
- **Emotional Quality**: Wisdom, stillness, clarity, contemplation
- **Similar To**: Similar to Garamond, Baskerville, or other classic serif typefaces
- **Font Size:** The binary code is visually smaller than the title — the title uses large lettering; the binary code is in a much smaller type directly underneath with generous space between.

### Font Size & Spacing Specifications:
- **Title**: 
  - Size: 32-36px (adjust slightly smaller for longer titles)
  - Weight: Medium
  - Case: All uppercase
  - Letter-spacing: 0.05em
  - Position: Centered, 120px from bottom edge of card
  
- **Binary Code**: 
  - Size: 18-20px
  - Weight: Light
  - Case: As shown
  - Letter-spacing: 0.05em
  - Position: Centered, 14px below title
  - Use slashed zeros (0̸) for clarity
  - Use a diagonal line through each zero in the binary code to distinguish them
  
- **Title/Subtitle Relationship**:
  - The title and binary code should feel like a cohesive unit
  - Maintain consistent positioning across all cards in the deck
  - Allow 14px vertical space between title and binary code

## COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Magenta (for inner world elements - the Fox)
- Secondary: Green (for outer world environment - the Forest)
- Accent: Purple (for highlights and key symbolic elements)
- White/off-white background with subtle texture
- Black for outlines and details with varying line weights

## KEY SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
- Simmering cauldron with reflective surface
- Silver-furred fox with luminous eyes
- Morning mist with emerging light paths
- Apprentices approaching from a distance

## FULL VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
Dawn breaks over a misty forest clearing where a magnificent copper cauldron sits on a bed of ancient stones, its surface still yet somehow alive. A silver-furred fox with luminous purple eyes sits perfectly still beside it, its dignified posture reflecting the same serene presence as the water within the vessel. The cauldron's polished interior holds liquid that appears simultaneously silver, crystal, and gold, shifting imperceptibly as it slowly simmers.

The surface of the liquid forms a perfect mirror, reflecting not just the canopy above but impossibly, the star-filled night sky and the fox's own knowing gaze. Thin wisps of steam rise in geometric patterns, creating momentary doorways of light that appear and vanish. Beneath the cauldron, a small flame burns steadily, neither diminishing nor growing.

Around the clearing's edge, the misty forest reveals barely-visible paths that seem to appear and disappear as the morning light filters through ancient trees. In the distance, hesitant figures—apprentices in simple robes—approach with expressions of wonder. The Doubtless Mirror at the clearing's center exists in perfect equilibrium, neither imposing answers nor inviting questions, simply reflecting truth beyond all inquiry.

## SEASONAL NARRATIVE COHERENCE:
This card is part of a four-card seasonal cycle for hexagram 101010. Maintain visual and symbolic coherence across this cycle:

- **Winter (10101000)**: "Questioning Mastery" - snow-covered cauldron with pulsing rhythms, silver-streaked fox with penetrating gaze
- **Spring (10101010)**: "Doubtless Mirror" - perfectly still cauldron with reflective surface, silver-furred fox with luminous eyes
- **Summer (10101011)**: "Threshold of Knowing" - actively bubbling cauldron with shifting patterns, playful russet fox with bright eyes
- **Fall (10101001)**: "Inquiry's Vessel" - intensely bubbling cauldron with complex patterns, focused fox with watchful stance

As the Spring expression of this hexagram, this card represents the integration point in the journey of After Completion, where both doubt and questioning transcend into direct knowing. The central motif (the cauldron) should appear in its most settled state, with a perfect reflective surface that shows truth directly.

## CHARACTER & SCENE INTEGRATION:
The illustration should harmoniously blend the following aspects:
- Sage archetype with Fox/Forest quality
- Spring atmosphere with Fire element influences
- After Completion energy (hexagram 101010)
- Siddhi Realization of Doubt→Inquiry→Truth

## MOOD AND ESSENCE:
The image should convey: Truth beyond questions, knowingness in reflection

## LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Full width title bar at bottom (15% of card height)
- "DOUBTLESS MIRROR" in bold, centered, all caps
- "10101010" in smaller text below
- Main illustration filling space above title bar with strong compositional flow

This card represents the culmination of the journey where questioning has transformed into direct knowing, and the Fox embodies the timeless wisdom that emerges after completion.

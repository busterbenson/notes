    desc: "This card represents the profound wisdom that emerges when we fully understand the nature of danger and water. It embodies the paradox of double water energy – the inner world of technical ability mirroring the outer world of social support – both flowing and potentially dangerous. In its Sage aspect in Winter, it reveals the transcendent understanding of how repeated challenges strengthen and deepen us."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.

      card_name: "Wisdom in Depths"
      card_creature: "A sage elder woman whose body appears composed of flowing water yet remains unbroken by the ice surrounding her, whose eyes contain the wisdom of countless survived dangers, perfectly balanced between twin abysses without fear"
      question_posed: "What wisdom might emerge if you fully embraced the challenges before you instead of avoiding them?"
      card_scene: "A serene female sage stands on a narrow ice bridge spanning two identical abysses in the heart of winter. Her body appears to be partially composed of flowing water that somehow maintains human form without freezing or dispersing, embodying the paradox of stability within perpetual flow. Her long silver hair moves like gentle currents, blending with her water-like essence. A new moon provides minimal light, leaving much in darkness, yet the woman navigates with perfect confidence. Below her, identical whirlpools spiral downward in mirror images, representing the double water energy of this card. Unlike someone who might tremble at the precipice, she stands precisely at the most dangerous point with perfect equilibrium, neither avoiding nor recklessly engaging with the peril. The winter landscape contains frozen waterfalls suspended in mid-flow, capturing the momentary stillness that winter brings to water's perpetual movement. Scattered around the sage are simple tools for water navigation – a boat hook, rope, divining rod – suggesting practical skill rather than mystical powers. Her expression shows neither fear nor recklessness but rather profound understanding – recognizing danger without being controlled by it. Her robes flow like water yet provide perfect protection against the winter cold, another embodiment of paradox. Small fish can be seen swimming within the abysses below, suggesting life and possibility within apparent danger. The surface of the narrow ice bridge shows cracks that have been repeatedly repaired, indicating that she has faced and overcome these challenges many times before. The entire scene conveys the profound wisdom that emerges when danger is neither denied nor feared but understood as an essential teacher and transformer."
      universal_symbol: "The ice bridge – the narrow path of wisdom that allows safe passage between twin dangers when navigated with awareness and skill"
      mood: "Profound serenity, transcendent understanding, the luminous wisdom that emerges when danger and challenge are neither feared nor sought but fully comprehended"

      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a serene female sage standing on a narrow ice bridge spanning two identical abysses in the heart of winter, her body partially composed of flowing water that maintains human form without freezing.

      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the sage as feminine, with graceful features and a serene, wise expression."

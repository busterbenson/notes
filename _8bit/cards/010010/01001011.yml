    desc: "The Abysmal Hero represents the masterful skill and confident navigation of dangerous waters. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 29 (Kan/The Abysmal) expressed through Summer's qualities of maturity and abundance. As the Hero in the cycle, this figure tackles depths and challenges with technical expertise and confident mastery. With technical ability but lacking intuition and capacity in the inner world, and support but lacking expectations and options in the outer world, this figure harnesses the paradox of double water energy with strategic skill. The hero transforms danger into opportunity through practical techniques and disciplined action."

      card_creature: "A confident male river captain whose skilled hands guide a perfectly designed vessel through twin whirlpools with precise control, neither fearing nor avoiding the danger but using its very energy to propel forward with purpose"
      question_posed: "How might your technical abilities transform challenges into opportunities for masterful action?"
      card_scene: "A focused male river captain stands at the helm of a precisely engineered vessel in the midst of a summer river's most dangerous stretch. Unlike the sage's still balance or the child's precarious curiosity, he actively navigates between twin whirlpools with confident expertise. His powerful frame is perfectly balanced against the rocking of the boat, muscles tensed in controlled readiness. A full moon illuminates the scene perfectly, revealing both the dangers and the narrow safe passage between them. The captain's hands grip specialized tools – a custom rudder and depth-measuring stick – that allow precise control in these treacherous waters. His vessel has been specifically designed for these conditions, with reinforced hulls and perfectly balanced weight distribution. The whirlpools themselves seem to respond to the captain's mastery, their energy actually helping to propel the boat forward rather than threatening to consume it. Along the riverbanks, careful observers can see markers and buoys placed by him during previous journeys, creating a mapped route through what appears to be impassable. Other vessels can be seen following at a safe distance, their occupants studying his techniques with admiration. The river's surface contains rapid currents, hidden rocks, and changing depths, yet the man's expression shows only focused determination and confident expertise. Strategic equipment is arranged within easy reach – emergency flotation, backup navigation tools, repair materials – prepared for any contingency yet not expecting disaster. The summer heat has made the river especially active, with increased flow and stronger whirlpools, yet this simply provides more energy for him to harness rather than avoid. The entire scene conveys the masterful skill that transforms challenges from obstacles into opportunities, not through avoiding danger but through strategic engagement and technical expertise."
      universal_symbol: "The specialized rudder – the precisely designed tool that transforms dangerous currents into directional force when wielded with expertise"
      mood: "Confident mastery, strategic expertise, the powerful competence that emerges when challenges and depths are approached with technical skill and tactical awareness"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a focused male river captain standing at the helm of a precisely engineered vessel, actively navigating between twin whirlpools in a summer river with confident expertise and specialized tools.
      Use GREEN for foreground elements (inner world) and GREEN for background/environment (outer world), with gold and deep blue accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '01001011' and card title 'MASTERFUL NAVIGATION' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a full moon illuminating both dangers and safe passage, markers and buoys creating a mapped route through the river, the whirlpools' energy helping propel the boat forward, and other vessels following at a distance to learn the captain's techniques.
      The scene should evoke the mood of confident mastery and strategic expertise, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer (Water/Summer symbols, heightened river activity from summer heat, the doubled water energy of summer season and water hexagram, flowing mastery).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the captain as masculine, with strong features and confident posture."

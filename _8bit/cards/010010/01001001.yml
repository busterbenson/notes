    desc: "The Abysmal Monster represents the overwhelming, destructive aspect of water and danger when they become uncontrollable. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 29 (Kan/The Abysmal) expressed through Fall's qualities of decline and dissolution. As the Monster in the cycle, this figure is consumed by depths and challenges that exceed all capacity for management. With technical ability but lacking intuition and capacity in the inner world, and support but lacking expectations and options in the outer world, this figure is overwhelmed by the paradox of double water energy. The monster emerges when challenges exceed our ability to navigate them, showing what happens when even skill and support prove insufficient against overwhelming force."

      card_creature: "A half-human, half-water male being whose body is dissolving into the very danger he sought to master, caught between twin maelstroms that have merged into a single catastrophic force, his tools and skills rendered useless by the sheer magnitude of the crisis"
      question_posed: "Where in your life might challenges have grown beyond your capacity to navigate them, threatening to overwhelm your resources?"
      card_scene: "A grotesquely transformed man is caught in the center of a catastrophic autumn flood, his body partially dissolved into the very waters he once sought to navigate. Unlike the female sage's serene balance, the child's playful exploration, or the male captain's masterful control, this man is being consumed by forces far beyond his ability to manage. The twin whirlpools that others successfully navigated have merged into a single devastating maelstrom that destroys everything in its path. A waning moon is barely visible through storm clouds, its light insufficient to reveal safe passage through the chaos. The specialized tools that once allowed control – rudders, navigational markers, carefully designed vessels – lie shattered and useless, overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the disaster. The autumn landscape shows trees uprooted, buildings collapsing, and former landmarks disappearing as the flood transforms everything. The man's expression shows a mixture of terror and resignation as he recognizes that his technical skills, which served him in lesser challenges, are completely inadequate for this level of catastrophe. The waters have breached all carefully constructed barriers, flowing with chaotic force that defies any attempt at channeling or direction. Items that should float are being pulled under by the current's force, while heavy objects are tossed about like leaves. Even creatures native to water – fish and amphibians – appear disoriented and threatened by the unnatural force of the merged whirlpools. The entire scene conveys the terrifying reality that some challenges exceed our capacity to manage them, no matter our skill or preparation, and that sometimes the most profound dangers come not from external threats but from the very forces we thought we had mastered."
      universal_symbol: "The merged maelstrom – once-separate challenges combining into a single overwhelming force that exceeds all capacity for control or navigation"
      mood: "Overwhelming catastrophe, helpless consumption, the terrifying reality that emerges when challenges exceed our capacity to navigate them regardless of skill or preparation"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a grotesquely transformed male figure caught in the center of a catastrophic autumn flood, his body partially dissolved into the water as twin whirlpools merge into a single devastating maelstrom.
      Use GREEN for foreground elements (inner world) and GREEN for background/environment (outer world), with purple and dark brown accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '01001001' and card title 'OVERWHELMING DEPTHS' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a waning moon barely visible through storm clouds, shattered navigation tools and vessels rendered useless, trees uprooting and structures collapsing, and even water creatures appearing disoriented by the unnatural force of the merged whirlpools.
      The scene should evoke the mood of overwhelming catastrophe and helpless consumption, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall (Earth/Fall symbols, autumn leaves swept up in the flood, the collision of water against earth, the destructive side of autumn storms and floods).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the figure as masculine, with visible masculine features despite the transformation."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.

      card_creature: "A skilled harvest-bringer who stands at the completion of one season and confidently prepares the soil for what must be planted next"
      question_posed: "How can you masterfully gather the fruits of your completed journey while skillfully preparing the ground for your next endeavor?"
      card_scene: "A confident figure stands at the exact boundary between two landscapes – behind them is a richly harvested field at sunset, while before them is a perfectly prepared plot of earth awaiting the first seeds. They wear ceremonial regalia that is half celebration garments, half work clothes, indicating their dual role as both celebrant of completion and architect of new beginnings. In one hand they hold a golden sickle that has completed its harvest work; in the other, they grasp seeds ready for planting. Their stance is balanced and poised, showing complete comfort in this transitional space. A waning moon hangs in the autumn sky, its light illuminating a stone marker that serves as both boundary post and ceremonial altar. Around the figure, a spiral path connects what has been with what will be, showing their expert navigation between states. Their shadow stretches behind them into the harvested field, marking the journey completed, while their gaze focuses intently on the prepared earth, calculating precisely where each new seed should be placed for optimal growth."
      universal_symbol: "The harvest scythe transformed into a planting tool – the instrument of completion becoming the instrument of beginning"

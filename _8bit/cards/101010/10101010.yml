    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Cycle Navigator"
      card_creature: "A bridge-keeper sage whose eyes simultaneously see what has been completed and what is yet to emerge, with hands that hold maps for worlds that exist and worlds still forming"
      question_posed: "What new journey awaits beyond the threshold of your recent completion, and how might the wisdom gained now guide your first steps forward?"
      card_scene: "An elder figure stands at a threshold between two distinct landscapes – behind them lies a completed labyrinth with paths that glow with the residual light of achievement, while before them stretches a fresh terrain with budding paths emerging from fertile soil. The sage holds a complex spiral key that fits both the lock they've just opened and the one they approach next. Their robes flow with a pattern that resembles both a zodiac wheel and sprouting seedlings. At their feet, the final stepping stone of the completed path transforms seamlessly into the first stone of the new journey. The waxing moon above illuminates this transition point with particular clarity, casting both the sage's shadow behind (marking what has been accomplished) and their silhouette ahead (hinting at what is to come). In their hand is a compass whose needle points simultaneously back and forward, suggesting that orientation comes from understanding both where one has been and where one is going."
      universal_symbol: "The lemniscate (infinity symbol) – the point where endings and beginnings are revealed as parts of the same continuous flow"
      mood: "Contemplative wisdom, strategic foresight, the calm certainty that comes from mastering transitions"

    desc: "This card represents the shadow aspects of completion that can manifest as an inability to truly finish and move on. It embodies the monstrous qualities that emerge when one clings too obsessively to past achievements, unable to release what has been completed. In its Monster aspect, it shows how accomplishment can become a prison when we cannot bear to transition to what comes next."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Achievement Prison"
      card_creature: "A crowned figure whose laurel wreath has grown into their skin, with eyes locked on completed works now turning to dust while refusing to see new possibilities"
      question_posed: "Where has your attachment to past achievements become a cage that prevents you from moving forward into new beginnings?"
      card_scene: "A disturbing figure sits atop a frozen throne made from trophies, medals, and symbols of past achievements fused together into a rigid structure. Their crown of laurels has grown roots that have painfully embedded into their flesh, making removal impossible without severe injury. In their lap rests a perfectly completed puzzle that they obsessively polish, even as its edges begin to crumble into dust. The figure is surrounded by mirrors that reflect only their past accomplishments, while the actual space beyond the throne room – visible through a doorway behind them – shows a landscape of new possibilities they refuse to see. Chains made of golden certificates and ribbons bind them to the throne. The new moon is visible through a high window, but rather than symbolizing new beginnings, it appears as a void, an emptiness the figure fears and rejects. Their eyes have a haunted quality as they stare at what they've completed, unable to release it even as it begins to decay in their hands. Scrolls of new ideas lie sealed and unopened at their feet."
      universal_symbol: "The gilded cage – achievement that once represented freedom now become a prison"
      mood: "Obsessive attachment, transitional paralysis, the anxiety of letting go what has been accomplished"

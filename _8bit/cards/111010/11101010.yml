    desc: "The Patient Sage represents the mastery of timing and wise anticipation. This card embodies the essence of Hexagram 5 (Waiting) in its most integrated form - the Spring Sage who understands that patience is not passive but a strategic act of power. With inner resources fully activated and minimal external support, this figure knows that true mastery involves waiting for exactly the right moment. The Spring season adds vitality and potential to this patience, suggesting readiness beneath the stillness."

      card_creature: "A silver-haired feminine sage with the watchful eyes of an owl, poised in perfect stillness at the edge of a mountain cliff as dawn breaks. Her simple robes flow in harmonic patterns with the wind, yet she herself remains perfectly centered and present."
      question_posed: "What worthy outcome deserves your patient attention and strategic waiting?"
      card_scene: "A feminine sage stands on a cliff edge at dawn, bathed in early spring light. Her white robes seem to merge with the mountain mist, creating a luminous aura around her form. In one hand she holds an hourglass where the sand flows upward rather than down, defying time itself. At her feet, small shoots push through melting snow. Behind her, water streams cascade down the mountain in the distance, flowing toward a lake that reflects the waxing moon still visible in the dawn sky. A heron stands in perfect stillness at the water's edge, mirroring her patience. The sage's expression reveals neither anxiety nor boredom but instead a profound presence and readiness, understanding that her waiting is not empty but pregnant with potential."
      universal_symbol: "An hourglass with sand flowing upward rather than downward"
      mood: "Serene alertness, poised anticipation, tranquil power"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a silver-haired female sage standing on a mountain cliff at dawn.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and green for background/environment (outer world), with gold and red accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11101010' and card title 'THE TIMELESS WATCHER' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature an hourglass with upward-flowing sand, spring buds emerging from snow, a waxing moon, and a patient heron by water.
      The scene should evoke the mood of serene alertness and tranquil power, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Spring.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

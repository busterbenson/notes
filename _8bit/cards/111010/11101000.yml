    desc: "The Patient Hero represents masterful endurance and disciplined waiting. This card embodies Hexagram 5 (Waiting) expressed through Winter's qualities of stillness and conservation, creating a powerful figure who perseveres through the harshest conditions without wasted action. The Hero archetype transforms waiting into an act of courage and skill, holding steady when others would rush or retreat. With complete inner resources activated against a backdrop of minimal external support, this figure demonstrates that sometimes the most heroic action is knowing when not to act."

      card_creature: "A masculine hero with frost-rimmed armor, perfectly still and alert at his solitary post. His vital strength is evident, not in movement but in his unflinching vigilance despite the bitter cold. His breath forms delicate ice crystals in the air with each measured exhalation."
      question_posed: "Where in your life does true strength require you to wait rather than act, and how can you transform that waiting into a heroic stance?"
      card_scene: "A masculine warrior stands motionless at a snow-covered mountain pass as twilight falls. His armor gleams with a thin layer of frost that has formed during his long watch, yet his posture reveals no fatigue. One hand rests on his sheathed sword - ready but not drawn - while the other holds a lantern barely kindled, conserving its fuel for the moment when light will be most needed. Behind him stretches a frozen lake, its surface unbroken like a mirror reflecting the new moon barely visible in the darkening sky. A hibernating bear sleeps in a cave nearby, embodying the winter's lesson of strategic conservation. At the hero's feet, a small spring of water remains unfrozen, representing the vital force that persists even in deepest winter. His eyes scan the horizon with intense focus, waiting for precisely the right moment that only he will recognize."
      universal_symbol: "A perfectly balanced sword standing upright on its point, defying gravity in complete stillness"
      mood: "Disciplined alertness, focused restraint, unshakable determination"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a frost-covered warrior standing guard at a snowy mountain pass.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and green for background/environment (outer world), with deep blue and silver accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11101000' and card title 'THE RESOLUTE GUARDIAN' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a frozen lake, new moon, sheathed sword, small lantern, and hibernating bear in a cave.
      The scene should evoke the mood of disciplined alertness and unshakable determination, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

      card_creature: "A young male fool with tousled hair adorned with autumn leaves, lounging comfortably in a half-harvested field. His eyes follow the patterns of clouds and falling leaves with genuine wonder, completely unconcerned with time's passage."
      question_posed: "How might you discover joy in the waiting itself, rather than fixating solely on what you're waiting for?"
      card_scene: "A youthful male figure reclines in a golden autumn field, his back against a weathered scarecrow. He balances a red leaf on his fingertip, watching it spin with childlike fascination. Around him, the harvest is partially complete - some stalks stand tall while others lie cut, representing time's selective passage. In the background, a stream winds through the landscape, its banks littered with fallen leaves that drift slowly with the current. The waning moon is visible in the afternoon sky, matching the season's energy of gentle release. A small nest with one remaining egg sits nearby, symbolizing patient anticipation. The fool's pack lies open beside him, suggesting he has paused his journey not from weariness but from spontaneous delight in the moment."
      universal_symbol: "A single autumn leaf suspended in mid-air, neither rising nor falling"
      mood: "Relaxed curiosity, unhurried wonder, spontaneous attentiveness"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a young man relaxing in an autumn field.
      Use white for foreground elements (inner world) and green for background/environment (outer world), with rusty orange and brown accents for highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '11101001' and card title 'THE WANDERING DREAMER' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature falling autumn leaves, a scarecrow, a waning moon, a half-harvested field, and a wandering stream with floating leaves.
      The scene should evoke the mood of relaxed curiosity and unhurried wonder, and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Fall.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

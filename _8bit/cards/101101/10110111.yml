    desc: "The Clinging Sage represents the profound wisdom that emerges when we fully understand the nature of attachment and clarity. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 30 (Li/The Clinging) expressed through Summer's qualities of maturity and abundance. As the most integrated form of this hexagram, the Summer Sage embodies transcendent understanding of how desire can be transformed into luminous insight. With intuition and capacity but lacking ability in the inner world, and expectations and options but lacking support in the outer world, this figure navigates the paradox of double fire energy with wisdom. The sage recognizes that fire, like desire, can be both illuminating and consuming - appreciating its brightness without being burned by it."

      card_name: "Illuminating Attachment"
      # 4 bits set to 1, so Sage is feminine
      card_creature: "A female sage whose body appears to be made of living flame yet is not consumed, whose eyes contain the wisdom of understanding the true nature of desire, holding identical fires in each palm that mirror rather than oppose each other"
      question_posed: "What attachments in your life might become sources of wisdom if fully understood rather than simply indulged or rejected?"
      card_scene: "A serene female sage sits at the edge of a summer lake under the full moon, her body radiating with magenta light that neither burns nor consumes. In each palm she holds identical flames that mirror each other perfectly, suggesting the doubled fire energy of this card. The sage's expression shows neither craving nor aversion, but profound understanding of fire's dual nature as both illuminator and consumer. The full moon overhead is partially eclipsed, creating a perfect balance of light and shadow. The lake's surface reflects both the sage's twin flames and the eclipsed moon, creating a mandala-like pattern of mirrored illumination. Around her, moths and other night creatures are drawn to the light but appear to dance with it rather than being consumed. The sage sits within a circle of perfectly arranged crystal vessels, each containing a small flame that neither grows nor diminishes. The light from these vessels creates a boundary that feels like protection rather than limitation. In the distance, lightning briefly illuminates the summer sky, echoing the contained fire closer at hand. The sage's robes appear both solid and fluid, flowing like water yet radiant like flame, embodying the paradox of fire expressed through water. Several items that would normally burn – paper, wood, cloth – rest within the flames without being consumed, transformed into vessels for light rather than fuel for consumption. The entire scene conveys the transcendent understanding that emerges when we neither reject desire nor become consumed by it, but fully understand its nature as a potential source of illumination."
      universal_symbol: "The mirrored flames – identical fires that illuminate rather than oppose each other, representing the transformed understanding of desire and attachment"
      mood: "Profound clarity, transcendent understanding, the luminous wisdom that emerges when desire and attachment are neither indulged nor rejected but fully understood"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a serene female sage sitting at the edge of a summer lake under a full moon, holding identical flames in each palm that mirror each other perfectly, her body radiating with light that neither burns nor consumes.
      Use MAGENTA for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with iridescent and luminous white accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10110111' and card title 'ILLUMINATING ATTACHMENT' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a partially eclipsed full moon, a lake surface reflecting both flames and moon in a mandala pattern, moths dancing with light rather than burning in it, and crystal vessels containing small flames arranged in a circle.
      The scene should evoke the mood of profound clarity and transcendent understanding, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer (Water/Summer symbols, flowing water reflecting fire, steam rising from water's surface, the paradoxical balance of fire and water elements).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the sage as feminine, with graceful features and a serene, wise expression."

    desc: "This card represents the profound wisdom that emerges when we fully understand the nature of attachment and clarity. It embodies the paradox of double fire energy – the inner world of intuition and capacity mirroring the outer world of expectations and options – both illuminating and potentially consuming. In its Sage aspect in Summer, it reveals the transcendent understanding of how desire can be transformed into luminous insight."

    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.
    oracle_card:
      card_name: "Illuminating Attachment"
      card_creature: "A female sage whose body appears to be made of living flame yet is not consumed, whose eyes contain the wisdom of understanding the true nature of desire, holding identical fires in each palm that mirror rather than oppose each other"
      question_posed: "What attachments in your life might become sources of wisdom if fully understood rather than simply indulged or rejected?"
      card_scene: "A serene female sage sits at the edge of a summer lake under the full moon, her body radiating with magenta light that neither burns nor consumes. In each palm she holds identical flames that mirror each other perfectly, suggesting the doubled fire energy of this card. The sage's expression shows neither craving nor aversion, but profound understanding of fire's dual nature as both illuminator and consumer. The full moon overhead is partially eclipsed, creating a perfect balance of light and shadow. The lake's surface reflects both the sage's twin flames and the eclipsed moon, creating a mandala-like pattern of mirrored illumination. Around her, moths and other night creatures are drawn to the light but appear to dance with it rather than being consumed. The sage sits within a circle of perfectly arranged crystal vessels, each containing a small flame that neither grows nor diminishes. The light from these vessels creates a boundary that feels like protection rather than limitation. In the distance, lightning briefly illuminates the summer sky, echoing the contained fire closer at hand. The sage's robes appear both solid and fluid, flowing like water yet radiant like flame, embodying the paradox of fire expressed through water. Several items that would normally burn – paper, wood, cloth – rest within the flames without being consumed, transformed into vessels for light rather than fuel for consumption. The entire scene conveys the transcendent understanding that emerges when we neither reject desire nor become consumed by it, but fully understand its nature as a potential source of illumination."
      universal_symbol: "The mirrored flames – identical fires that illuminate rather than oppose each other, representing the transformed understanding of desire and attachment"
      mood: "Profound clarity, transcendent understanding, the luminous wisdom that emerges when desire and attachment are neither indulged nor rejected but fully understood"

      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a serene female sage sitting at the edge of a summer lake under a full moon, holding identical flames in each palm that mirror each other perfectly, her body radiating with light that neither burns nor consumes.
      Use MAGENTA for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with deep purple and luminous white accents.

      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10110111' and card title 'ILLUMINATING ATTACHMENT' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a partially eclipsed full moon, a lake surface reflecting both flames and moon in a mandala pattern, moths dancing with light rather than burning in it, and crystal vessels containing small flames arranged in a circle.
      The scene should evoke the mood of profound clarity and transcendent understanding, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Summer (Water/Summer symbols, flowing water reflecting fire, steam rising from water's surface, the paradoxical balance of fire and water elements).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the sage as feminine, with graceful features and a serene, wise expression."

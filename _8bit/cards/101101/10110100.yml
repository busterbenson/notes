    # Imagine a modern oracle card that captures the essence of all 8-bits of the card and its associations
    # Style guidelines: Inspired by the clear and simple design of the Rider Waite Smith deck, the 
    # vibe of the Brady Tarot deck, and the humor and complexity of the Arcane Bullshit deck. 
    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.
    # Be sure to work in the colors (inner = foreground, outer = background) as well as the actual 8-bit binary code that this card represents.

      card_name: "Harnessed Fire"
      card_creature: "A masterful male smith who works confidently with twin flames, neither fearing nor worshipping their power but precisely controlling their energy to transform raw materials into tools of extraordinary precision and purpose"
      question_posed: "How might you skillfully direct your attachments and desires toward purposeful creation rather than being consumed by them?"
      card_scene: "A confident male blacksmith stands in a winter forge, the outside world covered in snow and darkness while his workspace glows with the precisely controlled magenta flames of twin forges. Unlike the female sage's contemplative holding or the female child's playful discovery, the smith actively directs these flames with skillful movements and specialized tools. His expression shows neither the detachment of wisdom nor the naivety of innocence, but rather the focused determination of expertise. The darkness outside is complete, with only the outline of a new moon visible against the night sky, creating a sharp contrast with the directed light within the forge. Through the open door, a path through the snow is visible, illuminated by carefully placed lamps that guide travelers safely through the winter night. The smith works simultaneously on two identical pieces of metal, heating them to precisely the same temperature in separate forges, creating mirrored objects that will function in perfect tandem. Around the forge, specialized tools hang in perfect order – tongs, hammers, quenching baths – each designed to work with fire in different ways. Ice crystals form on the edges of the forge's open windows, neither melting completely nor encroaching further inward, held in perfect balance by the smith's precise control of temperature. A complex mechanical device near completion sits on a workbench – a lantern of unprecedented design that will amplify and direct light with extraordinary precision. The smith wears protective gear that allows close work with dangerous flame without risk of harm, neither avoiding fire nor being consumed by it. The entire scene conveys the masterful competence that emerges when the energy of attachment and desire is neither rejected nor indulged, but skillfully directed toward purposeful creation."
      universal_symbol: "The smith's tongs – precise tools that allow engagement with fire without danger, representing the skilled harnessing of desire and attachment"
      mood: "Confident expertise, strategic control, the powerful competence that emerges when brightness and attachment are neither feared nor worshipped but masterfully directed"

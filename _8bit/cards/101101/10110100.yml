    desc: "The Clinging Hero represents the masterful control and strategic harnessing of fire and clarity. This card captures the essence of Hexagram 30 (Li/The Clinging) expressed through Winter's qualities of restraint and conservation. As the Hero in the cycle, this figure tackles brightness and attachment with tactical skill and confident mastery. With intuition and capacity but lacking ability in the inner world, and expectations and options but lacking support in the outer world, this figure harnesses the paradox of double fire energy with strategic precision. The hero transforms potentially destructive flame into purposeful illumination through practical techniques and disciplined action."

      card_creature: "A masterful male smith who works confidently with twin flames, neither fearing nor worshipping their power but precisely controlling their energy to transform raw materials into tools of extraordinary precision and purpose"
      question_posed: "How might you skillfully direct your attachments and desires toward purposeful creation rather than being consumed by them?"
      card_scene: "A confident male blacksmith stands in a winter forge, the outside world covered in snow and darkness while his workspace glows with the precisely controlled magenta flames of twin forges. Unlike the female sage's contemplative holding or the female child's playful discovery, the smith actively directs these flames with skillful movements and specialized tools. His expression shows neither the detachment of wisdom nor the naivety of innocence, but rather the focused determination of expertise. The darkness outside is complete, with only the outline of a new moon visible against the night sky, creating a sharp contrast with the directed light within the forge. Through the open door, a path through the snow is visible, illuminated by carefully placed lamps that guide travelers safely through the winter night. The smith works simultaneously on two identical pieces of metal, heating them to precisely the same temperature in separate forges, creating mirrored objects that will function in perfect tandem. Around the forge, specialized tools hang in perfect order – tongs, hammers, quenching baths – each designed to work with fire in different ways. Ice crystals form on the edges of the forge's open windows, neither melting completely nor encroaching further inward, held in perfect balance by the smith's precise control of temperature. A complex mechanical device near completion sits on a workbench – a lantern of unprecedented design that will amplify and direct light with extraordinary precision. The smith wears protective gear that allows close work with dangerous flame without risk of harm, neither avoiding fire nor being consumed by it. The entire scene conveys the masterful competence that emerges when the energy of attachment and desire is neither rejected nor indulged, but skillfully directed toward purposeful creation."
      universal_symbol: "The smith's tongs – precise tools that allow engagement with fire without danger, representing the skilled harnessing of desire and attachment"
      mood: "Confident expertise, strategic control, the powerful competence that emerges when brightness and attachment are neither feared nor worshipped but masterfully directed"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a confident male blacksmith standing in a winter forge, working with twin fires to create mirrored objects, precisely controlling the flames with specialized tools and skilled movements.
      Use MAGENTA for foreground elements (inner world) and MAGENTA for background/environment (outer world), with gold and deep blue accents.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10110100' and card title 'HARNESSED FIRE' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a new moon outlined against night sky, a snowy path illuminated by carefully placed lamps, ice crystals forming perfect boundaries at forge edges, and specialized fire-working tools arranged in precise order.
      The scene should evoke the mood of confident expertise and strategic control, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter (Air/Winter symbols, the contrast of contained heat against winter cold, precise geometric patterns of ice and metal, the balance of fire element within airy intellectual precision).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean. Clearly depict the blacksmith as masculine, with strong features and confident posture."

  basic_info: 
    desc: "This card embodies the energy of the Seven of Swords expressed in the Winter season as a Hero archetype. With intuition, capacity, expectations, and support all present, but lacking ability and clear options, this card represents a strategic retreat or calculated risk. The Winter setting brings a cold, intellectual approach to this energy, suggesting careful planning and foresight rather than brash action. As the Hero archetype, this represents mastery of strategic withdrawal and self-preservation, knowing when to conserve energy and resources for the battles that truly matter."

      card_creature: "The Frost Tactician - a feminine figure with the keen, watchful presence of an arctic fox, moving expertly through the winter landscape while carrying precious knowledge"
      question_posed: "What battles should you not fight? What resources must you preserve for more important confrontations?"
      card_scene: "Under a dark winter sky lit only by cold stars, a feminine figure in gold and silver cloaks moves silently through a snow-covered mountain pass. She carries a strategic map and three swords, leaving four others partially hidden in the snow behind her. Her face shows determination and calculation, as if executing a complex plan requiring perfect timing. In the background, a fortress casts long shadows on the snow, while hidden pathways reveal themselves only to those who know where to look. The scene conveys a sense of necessary retreat, but one executed with mastery and foresight rather than fear."
      universal_symbol: "A crossed sword and map under a crescent moon"
      mood: "Calculating, strategic, resourceful, deliberate"

      # Image generation prompt - use this template but fill with specific details
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a feminine figure in winter attire moving through a snowy mountain pass at night, carrying three swords and a strategic map.
      Use magenta for foreground elements (inner world) and cyan for background/environment (outer world), with gold highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '10111000' and card title 'STRATEGIC FROST' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a crescent moon, arctic fox companion, crossed swords, and a strategic map.
      The scene should evoke the mood of calculation, strategy, and deliberate action and incorporate subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter.
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."

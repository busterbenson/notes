  name: "Refined Lunar Mapping System"
  description: "Maps each card to a specific half-phase of the moon during a specific lunar cycle in a specific season, creating a 1:1 mapping between calendar days and cards."
  
  # Calculation Method
  calculation:
    season: "Determined by bits 7-8 (00=Winter, 10=Spring, 11=Summer, 01=Fall)"
    lunar_cycle: "(bit_count_positions_1_6 % 4) + 1  # Yields lunar cycle 1-4 within the season"
    lunar_phase: "(decimal_value ÷ 2) % 8  # Yields phase 0-7"
    phase_half: "decimal_value % 2  # 0 = First Half, 1 = Second Half"
    complete_formula: "Each card represents a unique season + lunar cycle + lunar phase + phase half combination"
  
  # Astronomical Correspondences
  astronomical_meaning:
    total_combinations: "4 seasons × 4 lunar cycles × 8 phases × 2 halves = 256 unique combinations"
    coverage: "Each of the 256 cards maps to exactly one combination"
    calendar_precision: "Each card represents approximately 1.75 days in a specific lunar month in a specific season"
    inactive_cycles: "When a season has fewer than 4 lunar cycles, cards mapped to non-occurring cycles represent potential or background influences"

        note: "This cycle doesn't occur in every season every year, but cards mapped to it still hold meaningful energy"

# Calendar Implementation
calendar_implementation:
  day_to_card_mapping:
    description: "This system creates a direct 1:1 mapping between calendar days and oracle cards"
    process: "For any calendar date, determine its season, lunar cycle within that season, lunar phase, and phase half"
    formula: |
      1. Identify the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
      2. Identify which lunar cycle of that season (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)
      3. Identify the lunar phase based on illumination percentage
      4. Identify whether it's the first or second half of that phase
      5. This maps to exactly one card in the oracle
    astronomical_precision: "Each card corresponds to approximately 1.75 days in the lunar cycle"
  
  calculator_guidance:
    description: "A digital or physical calendar reference can be created to map dates to cards"
    suggestion: "Create a perpetual lunar calendar that maps each day of the year to its corresponding card"
    special_cases: "When a 4th lunar cycle doesn't occur in a season, those cards represent potential or background energies"

# Card Generation Implications
card_generation:
  card_identification:
    naming: "Include the complete lunar designation in the card's identification"
    example: "Strategic Frost (Dark Moon Emerging, Inception Cycle of Winter)"
  
  visual_elements:
    lunar_indicator: "Include a small lunar phase icon showing exact illumination percentage"
    color_scheme: "Use the phase half's associated color as an accent in the card design"
    symbolic_elements: "Incorporate symbols associated with the specific phase half"
  
  interpretation_guidance:
    - "Include guidance specific to the phase half's unique qualities"
    - "Note how the lunar cycle within the season affects the energy expression"
    - "Highlight the card's connection to specific days in the calendar year"
    - "Provide insight into how the card's energy differs from other cards of the same hexagram in different lunar expressions"

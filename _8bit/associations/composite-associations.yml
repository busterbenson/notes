# Composite Associations

# Expanded frameworks that combine various bit patterns and frameworks
composite_associations:

  # These expand upon the I Ching's trigrams by giving a bit more nuance to them depending on 
  # if they are in the "bottom" (first 3 bits) or "top" (second 3 bits) of the hexagram (first 6 bits)

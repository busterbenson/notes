# 8-Bit Oracle Associations

This directory contains reference documents and mappings for the 8-Bit Oracle divination system. These files provide detailed explanations of the symbolic frameworks and their integration within the system.

## Core Reference Files

- **core-systems.yml**: Main structured data file containing all bit definitions, patterns, and meaning systems
- **lunar-cycle.yml**: Complete lunar cycle system with phase-half precision mapping
- **tarot-final-mapping.md**: Definitive mapping of tarot cards to 6-bit patterns
- **hebrew-letter-major-arcana.md**: Hebrew letter associations for the Major Arcana
- **gene-keys-reference.md**: Overview of the Gene Keys system and its integration 
- **quick-reference-guide.md**: Concise lookup tables for card interpretation
- **archetype-guide.md**: Explanation of the archetype system (Sage, Fool, Hero, Monster)
- **gender-assignment.md**: Rules for gender assignment in different archetypes
- **fractal-manifestations.md**: Framework for interpreting patterns across different scales

## Using These References

While the `core-systems.yml` file contains the structured data needed for card generation, the markdown files provide deeper context, rationale, and detailed explanations that wouldn't fit well in YAML format.

The files in this directory serve several purposes:

1. **Documentation**: They explain the reasoning behind specific mappings and associations
2. **Learning Resources**: They help users understand the complex symbolic systems integrated in the oracle
3. **Reference Material**: They provide details that can enrich card interpretations
4. **System Architecture**: They document how different symbolic systems interrelate

## Reading a Card

1. **Identify the Binary Pattern**: Each card has an 8-digit binary pattern (e.g., 10100000)
2. **Note Active Resources**: Each '1' indicates an active resource, each '0' an inactive one
3. **Analyze Inner World**: Bits 1-3 show your internal resources
4. **Analyze Outer World**: Bits 4-6 show your external resources
5. **Note the Cycle Phase**: Bits 7-8 show the elemental quality and cycle phase
6. **Consider Associated Systems**: Reference I Ching, Tarot, and other correspondences

## Sample Readings

### Single Card Reading
1. Draw a card
2. Analyze which resources are active/inactive
3. Consider how this pattern relates to your question
4. Reference the card's associated systems for deeper meaning
5. For transformation focus, explore the card's Gene Key journey (Shadow → Gift → Siddhi)

### Three Card Reading
1. Draw three cards: Past/Present/Future or Situation/Challenge/Advice
2. Note which resources are consistently present or absent
3. Observe how the patterns evolve from card to card
4. Pay attention to the cycle phases and their progression

### Resource Grid Reading
1. Draw eight cards and arrange in a 4x2 grid
2. Top row: Inner World (Intuition, Ability, Capacity, Inner Integration)
3. Bottom row: Outer World (Expectations, Support, Options, Outer Integration)
4. This reading provides detailed insight into each resource area

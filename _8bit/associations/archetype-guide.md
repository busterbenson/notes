# Archetype Guide

## Overview

The 8-bit Oracle employs a four-archetype system that maps to the four seasons and their energies. Each card has both an inherent archetype that is determined by the inner and outer world resource patterns. This guide explains how the system works and how archetypes interact with seasonal cycles.

## Determining Inner and Outer World States

The foundation of the archetype system is based on the state of the inner and outer world resources.

### Inner World (Bits 1-3)

- **Bit 1:** Intuition - Do you trust your natural instincts?
- **Bit 2:** Ability - Do you have the skills and know-how?
- **Bit 3:** Capacity - Do your circumstances provide enough resources?

The inner world is considered:
- **Active (1)** if two or more of these bits are 1
- **Inactive (0)** if two or more of these bits are 0

### Outer World (Bits 4-6)

- **Bit 4:** Expectations - Are you aligned with cultural norms?
- **Bit 5:** Support - Do your relationships support you?
- **Bit 6:** Options - Are possible paths clear to you?

The outer world is considered:
- **Active (1)** if two or more of these bits are 1
- **Inactive (0)** if two or more of these bits are 0

## Resonant Season Mapping

The combination of inner and outer world states creates four possible patterns, each associated with a season:

| Inner World | Outer World | Pattern | Resonant Season |
|-------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Inactive (0) | Inactive (0) | 00    | Winter |
| Active (1)   | Inactive (0) | 10    | Spring |
| Active (1)   | Active (1)   | 11    | Summer |
| Inactive (0) | Active (1)   | 01    | Fall   |

## The Four Archetypes

Each card expresses one of four archetypes, determined by the relationship between the card's resonant season and the season represented by its cycle bits (bits 7-8).

| Relationship | Archetype | Color | Qualities |
|--------------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Resonant Season | **Sage** | Iridescent | Integrated, wise, harmonious expression |
| Next Season | **Fool** | Turquoise | Innocent, new beginning, fresh perspective |
| Third Season | **Hero** | Gold | Skilled, masterful, powerful expression |
| Fourth Season | **Monster** | Purple | Excessive, challenging, shadow expression |

### Seasonal Progression

The natural progression of seasons follows this order:
Winter → Spring → Summer → Fall → Winter

For example, if a card's resonant season is Winter:
- Sage expression = Winter
- Fool expression = Spring (next season)
- Hero expression = Summer (third season)
- Monster expression = Fall (fourth season)

## Archetype Qualities

### Sage
The Sage represents wisdom, integration, and harmony. It appears when a card's resonant season matches its cycle bits' season. The Sage archetype embodies the most balanced expression of the card's energy, where inner and outer worlds are appropriately aligned with the cycle phase.

### Fool
The Fool represents innocence, new beginnings, and fresh perspectives. It appears when a card's resonant season is followed by its cycle bits' season. The Fool archetype embodies potential and untested energy, where the card's pattern is moving into a new phase with openness and curiosity.

### Hero
The Hero represents skill, mastery, and accomplished power. It appears when a card's resonant season is two steps ahead of its cycle bits' season. The Hero archetype embodies competence and achievement, where the card's pattern has matured and developed strong capabilities.

### Monster
The Monster represents excess, challenge, and shadow aspects. It appears when a card's resonant season is three steps ahead of (or one step behind) its cycle bits' season. The Monster archetype embodies the imbalanced or exaggerated expression of the card's qualities, where energy has become distorted or overwhelming.

## Example Applications

### Card 00000000 (The Moon in Winter)
- **Inner World:** 0 (all bits off)
- **Outer World:** 0 (all bits off)
- **Resonant Season:** Winter
- **Cycle Bits:** 00 = Winter
- **Archetype:** Sage (Winter resonance in Winter cycle)
- **Expression:** The integrated wisdom of the void, perfect emptiness and potential

### Card 11100001 (Return in Spring)
- **Inner World:** 1 (bits 1-3 all on)
- **Outer World:** 0 (bits 4-5 off, bit 6 on)
- **Resonant Season:** Spring
- **Cycle Bits:** 01 = Spring
- **Archetype:** Sage (Spring resonance in Spring cycle)
- **Expression:** The integrated wisdom of renewal and growth, harmonious beginning

## Usage in Readings

The archetype of a card provides insight into how its energy is currently manifesting and the quality of its expression:

- **Sage cards** suggest alignment and wisdom. The situation is unfolding in a balanced way.
- **Fool cards** indicate new beginnings and untested potential. Fresh approaches are favored.
- **Hero cards** point to competence and achievement. Skill and mastery are available.
- **Monster cards** reveal challenges and excess. Something may be out of balance or exaggerated.

The archetype system provides a framework for understanding the qualitative expression of each card's binary pattern, adding nuance and depth to readings.

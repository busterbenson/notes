    desc: "This card represents darkness, the unconscious, and the hidden. The void, mystery, and that which cannot be clearly seen. Symbolizes confusion, illusion, and hidden dangers. The all-zeros pattern perfectly captures the absence of clarity and certainty - no resources activated means navigating in darkness."

    # The card should use a limited color palette, lines as if created via risograph, be full-bleed, 
    # include the name on the card, as well as the card_scene, some hint of the resonant season, and the universal symbol.
    # The names of the cards should feel like they are part of a cohesive deck, and be completely devoid of cliches.

      # Limited color risograph-style illustration of [short scene description].
      # Use [INNER WORLD COLOR] for foreground elements (inner world) and [OUTER WORLD COLOR] for background/environment (outer world), with [ARCHETYPE HIGHLIGHT COLOR] for highlights.
      # Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      # Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code "[XXXXXXXX]" and card title "[CARD TITLE]" in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      # Feature [key symbolic elements, e.g., moon phase, animal companions, symbolic object].

      # Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean.

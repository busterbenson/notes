  basic_info: 
    desc: "This card represents darkness, the unconscious, and the hidden - the void where all potential lies dormant. The all-zeros pattern perfectly captures the absence of clarity and certainty, with no resources activated. This is the Moon in its Winter aspect, embodying the Sage archetype who has transcended even the darkness. Rather than fearing the void, the Sage inhabits and understands it as the source of all creation. Symbolizing mystery, confusion, and hidden forces, this card reminds us that wisdom can be found in acknowledging the unknown."

      card_name: "Void Mirror"
      card_creature: "A gender-neutral sage whose body appears as a silhouette of stars against the deeper darkness, merging with the void yet somehow distinct from it, whose eyes reflect the unlimited potential contained in absolute emptiness"
      question_posed: "What wisdom might emerge if you fully embraced the darkness you've been avoiding?"
      card_scene: "A gender-neutral figure with indistinct features stands perfectly still at the center of absolute darkness. Their form is defined only by an outline of tiny stars, creating a silhouette of cosmic light against the even deeper void behind them. There is no landscape, no horizon, only graduated shades of darkness extending in all directions. Where the figure's eyes should be, there are instead two perfectly circular voids that somehow reflect the observer's own gaze back at them. In one hand, the figure holds what appears to be a mirror made of polished obsidian that reflects nothing yet seems to contain everything. The figure's posture conveys neither fear nor discomfort in this lightless realm, but rather a profound understanding and acceptance of darkness as the necessary foundation of all existence. Around their feet, what initially appears to be simple ripples in water reveals itself to be ripples in space-time itself, as if the void is a fluid medium through which all potential must pass. The new moon is present only as an absence against the black sky, defined by the stars that aren't visible within its boundary. The entire scene conveys a sense of vastness and infinite potential rather than emptiness or negation - the darkness not as an end but as the beginning of all possibility."
      universal_symbol: "The obsidian mirror - reflecting nothing yet containing everything, representing the paradox of emptiness as the source of all potential"
      mood: "Profound acceptance, mysterious anticipation, the serene recognition that all creation emerges from darkness and returns to it"

      # Image generation prompt
      prompt_for_image_gen: "Limited color risograph-style illustration of a gender-neutral figure standing in absolute darkness, their body appearing only as a silhouette of tiny stars against the deeper void.
      Use BLACK for foreground elements (inner world) and BLACK for background/environment (outer world), with IRIDESCENT midnight blue highlights.
      Maintain risograph/woodblock print texture with strong contrast, 3-4 colors max, and minimalistic geometric forms.
      Include a clean, full-width title bar at the bottom, with centered 8-bit code '00000000' and card title 'VOID MIRROR' in bold, without corner decorations or symbols.
      Feature a handheld obsidian mirror that reflects nothing, ripples in space-time at the figure's feet, and the new moon visible only as an absence of stars in the night sky.
      The scene should evoke the mood of profound acceptance and mysterious anticipation, incorporating subtle seasonal/elemental references appropriate for Winter (e.g., stillness, breath visible in cold air, crystalline formations in darkness).
      Style should blend Rider-Waite simplicity with modern symbolic abstraction, emotionally resonant but compositionally clean."
